<p><a href="http://appropriateprojects.com/taxonomy/term/3">Appropriate Projects</a> is an initiative of Water Charity, conceived to slash through the red tape and get projects done immediately.
Access to safe water is a human right, and we are fighting to achieve this goal for every person on this planet. We will not sit around while people are dying and suffering from illness due to lack of water, contaminated water, and unsanitary conditions. </p>
