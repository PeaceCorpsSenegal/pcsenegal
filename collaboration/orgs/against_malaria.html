<p><img src="collaboration/orgs/img/against_malaria_logo_100.jpg" id="floatleft" />The <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.org">Against Malaria Foundation</a> (AMF, www.againstmalaria.com) is a US (501c3) and UK registered non-profit headquartered in Britain that support efforts to combat malaria, particularly through effective insecticide treated bed net distribution and education campaigns.  Peace Corps Volunteers in Senegal are working with Against Malaria to distribute tens of thousands of mosquito bed nets, ensure that they are put up and used, and to provide the education that will help reduce deaths and disease. 100% of the funds AMF receives buys nets and all donations are linked to specific distributions bringing an efficiency, transparency and accountability, as well as very strong donor feedback and engagement, to malaria bed net fundraising and distribution. <br />
