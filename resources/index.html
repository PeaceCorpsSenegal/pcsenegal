<h1>Highlighted Resources</h1>
<p>Peace Corps Senegal volunteers have created a wide variety of helpful resources for current and future volunteers in order to pass on their experience and expertise.  These comprehensive guides are part of our broader strategy to retain institutional memory within Peace Corps Senegal.  Volunteers over the years have been able to create new guides and add to existing ones.   Here is a selection of resources created by Peace Corps Volunteers in coordination with local counterparts. We also have a new <a href="?page=resources.php&add=tables">Resource Library</a>, containing all of our currently hosted media and case studies.</p>
