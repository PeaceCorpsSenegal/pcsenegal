participated in the Expo from across the country. Artisans came from Bambay, Dakar, Diourbel, Fatick,
Joal, Kaolack, Kebemare, Kedougou, Mar Lodj, Ngeye Mekhe, Mboro, Thies, and Tivuouane. Painters,
jewelers, tailors, juice makers, boutique owners, Basari (ethnic group in Kedougou) artisans, cereal
producers, prÃªt-a-porter creators, wood sculptors, and batick (tie dye) artisans all attended.</p>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/expo_2010_03_600.jpg"><img src="photos/thumbs/expo_2010_03_200.jpg" id="floatright"/></a>Talla Diop, the Peace Corps Small Enterprise and Development Program Training Assistant, led a training
on creating an artisan association. The Peace Corps Artisan Exposition has been organized by PCVs
since its inception and the goal of the training was to start delegating more responsibility for organizing
the Exposition to the Artisans themselves. The artisans were extremely receptive to the idea of an
artisan association and held elections directly after Talla Diop's training. Two artisans, from different
regions, were chosen as co-presidents and coordinators of the artisanal network. These two artisans
will disseminate information about future Expos and will handle the logistics for next year's Peace Corps
Artisan Exposition as well as coordinate attendance of association members to attend other expositions
around the country.</p>

<p>The Artisan Association made its first cross collaboration connection this year.<a class="gallery" href="photos/expo_2010_05_600.jpg"><img src="photos/thumbs/expo_2010_05_200.jpg" id="floatleft"/></a> With the spirit of
partnership in mind, a leather worker from Mboro and a tailor in Bambey joined forces. The tailor
from Bambey makes popular cloth, sac bags that he has wanted to attach leather handles to. At the
Exposition he spoke with the leather worker and they have plans to work together to create cloth bags
with leather handles. A boutique owner, who also works as a tailor from Kaolack, bought goods from
several other artisans at the Expo to sell at her boutique. Many artisans also spoke about how they
learned new techniques from other artisans and noted new and better marketing ideas. The educational
concept of "learning by doing," and learning through observation were obviously on display at this
year's Expo.</p>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/expo_2010_04_600.jpg"><img src="photos/thumbs/expo_2010_04_200.jpg" id="floatright"/></a>Eleven new artisans joined the Peace Corps Artisan Expo network this year and the increased marketing
efforts combined with the increase in artisan participates led to an exceptional customer turnout for
the Artisan Expo. Three weekends prior to the Exposition and the day before the Exposition volunteers
placed flyers throughout downtown Dakar as well as at the luxury hotels throughout the city. Customer
satisfaction surveys handed out at the Exposition itself reported that many customers attended the
Expo for the first time because they saw the flyers in Dakar. Emails with promotional material for the
Expo were also sent to prominent women's groups in Dakar, ex-pat schools, and other list-servs, which
brought in many customers. Several artisans made contact with the owner of a hair salon/ boutique
in downtown Dakar who bought a plethora of items and took artisans' contact information in order to
purchase future goods from the artisans.</p>

<p>With intensive marketing efforts, the addition of eleven artisans, and committed PCVs who diligently
worked with their artisans throughout the year, this year's Artisan Expo was the most successful
event to date. The artisans sold a combined 3,787,700 CFA (approximately $7,600) and repeatedly
commented that this year's Artisan Expo was the best to date due to cross collaboration, new idea
generation, and increased revenues.</p>
