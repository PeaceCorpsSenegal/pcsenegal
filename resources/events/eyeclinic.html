<h1>Kedougou Eye Clinic</h1>

<p>Peace Corps Senegal in partnership with Right to Sight and Health, an american NGO founded by opthamologist Judith Simon, are currently performing an eye clinic at the regional hospital in Kedougou. In the first two days, they have successfully screened over 200 people, providing treatment and counseling,  and performed 14 cataract and secondary implant surgeries. There work has been greatly facilitated by the tremendous local staff led by Regionale Chef du Medcin Dr. Doudou Sene.  Dr. Amadou Fall spent the last two weeks providing pre-screenings, and Karfa Keita with PCV Michele Lehman advertised extensively on the radio to inform the local population of this amazing opportunity.</p>

<p>The goal of the 10-day clinic is to serve over 1000 people and perform 100 surgeries, and they are well on their way.
