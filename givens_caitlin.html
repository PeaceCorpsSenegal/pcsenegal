<p>I was returning to my village, in the northeast corner of Senegal, after a trip to the capital city to drop off my first visitor from home. The only way back to my site was in a worn-out station wagon that had no shocks, no window panes, and no seat belts. I was tightly wedged between two large men, but I was glad to have snagged the last seat in the middle row, narrowly avoiding suffocating in the backseat with the family of five. Thankfully the cold season was upon us, and I was anticipating a few months  relief from the Sahel Desert's 130 degree days. Thirteen hours into the two-day trek, we had reached the point in the drive when my mind had gone numb and I no longer noticed my own discomfort.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the driver stopped the car and the young mother in the backseat climbed out. She hobbled to the side of the road, doubled over in pain. In my mediocre Pulaar, I asked the other passengers what was wrong. The man in the front seat chuckled and turned to me, smiling.</p>
<p>"She's having a baby" he said.</p>
<p>"What?!" I shouted. My head began to spin.</p>
<p>Should I grab my medical kit? Is there a village nearby? How am I going to cut the cord? What about her other three children waiting in the backseat?</p>
<p>But there was no time to think. I ran to her.</p>
<p>I knelt beside her and she grabbed my hand. Silently, she lifted up her brightly patterned robe just enough so that I could see ... the baby's head was crowning! Moments later, amidst the sand and thorns, on the edge of the desert, I delivered a healthy baby boy. With no tools and no medical facility for 30 kilometers, my bare hands served as his first welcome into this world.</p>
<p>From somewhere behind me another passenger appeared with a dull razor blade and a tattered piece of string. I tied-off and cut the umbilical cord and wrapped the baby in his mother's headscarf. Twenty minutes later we were back on the road. At his mother's insistence, our newest passenger was nestled in my arms.</p>
<p>As we rode along my mind was reeling with excitement and disbelief. What if something had gone wrong? What if he hadn't presented correctly? I shuddered at the thought.</p>
<p>After that day I dedicated the rest of my service to working with community-based women's groups. While assisting midwives at a local health facility, I witnessed the efforts of inadequately trained staff and the poor conditions that Senegalese women endured.</p>
<p>Although my academic background in development studies had already highlighted the need to improve women's health on a global scale, my Peace Corps experience gave me a new depth of understanding that I could not have achieved had I not lived and worked alongside these incredible Senegalese women. The knowledge and experience that I gained by working in the Peace Corps determined my decision to become a Certified Nurse Midwife.</p>
<p>In May 2011 I became a licensed RN. Since then I have continued my studies at Georgetown University and in 2013 I will graduate as a Certified Nurse Midwife and a Women's Health Nurse Practitioner. The Peace Corps shaped my life and helped me to find my path. Now I will be able to pass on the gift I have been given by working to improve the health of women and their children.</p>
