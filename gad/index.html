<H1>Gender and Development</H1>

<p>Peace Corps Senegal volunteers frequently incorporate gender development (GAD) work into their projects, believing that only through striving for gender equality and flexibility can a nation reach its full potential.</p>
<h3>SeneGAD</h3>
<p>The Peace Corps Senegal Gender and Development (SeneGAD) volunteer organization assists all volunteers in reaching their goals through fundraising events, guest speakers, and collaborative, region wide efforts. Their website is hosted here at <a href="http://senegad.pcsenegal.org" target="_blank">senegad.pcsenegal.org</a></p>

<p>Some of the most successful GAD projects here in Peace Corps Senegal have been youth leadership camps, in which high school age students from one or more regions are gathered together for a week to share and learn, as well as have some fun.
