<H1>Secondary Projects</H1>

<p>Peace Corps Senegal volunteers are engaged in many projects which do not fit directly under their assigned job description. We encource volunteers to seek out ways to work with their communities no matter what the field, and believe that this cross-sector and non-sector collaboration greatly enriches the work we do here in Senegal.</p>

<p>Currently, volunteers are involved in the fields of:
	<ul>
    	<li><a href="index.php?page=apptech/index.html">Appropriate Technology</a></li>
    	<li><a href="index.php?page=gad/index.html">Gender and Development</a></li>
    	<li><a href="index.php?page=radio/index.html">Radio Production</a></li>
    	<li><a href="index.php?page=secondary_proj/waste_management/index.html">Waste Management</a></li>
    </ul>
