<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In 2009, seven Peace Corps Volunteers in and around Linguère collaboratively raised money to acquire 2,185 long-lasting insecticidal bed nets through Against Malaria. In March and April, 2010 they collaborated with seven health structures in the department of Linguère to distribute the nets to remotely located pregnant women and children under five who had not received nets in previous national and NGO-led distributions.</p>

<h3>Context</h3> 
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/linguere_nets_01_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/linguere_nets_01_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright"/></a>Though malaria is less prevalent in the Linguère department, which has a hot and dry climate, than in other wetter areas of Senegal, it is still a common serious disease and a leading cause of death for children under five and pregnant women in the zone.  Yet, malaria is preventable through household environmental interventions, the use of insect repellant and, most importantly, the use of bed nets at night. By sleeping under insecticidal bed nets, people protect themselves against malaria and prevent the spread of the disease to others.</p> 
<p>Without large-scale distributions of free nets, particularly in isolated areas where residents don’t have easy, regular access to health facilities, many people around Linguère either cannot find nets or cannot afford to purchase them. They rely on net distributions and corresponding educational campaigns to for the resources and knowledge to prevent malaria.</p>

<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p>Initially, in 2009, volunteers planned to conduct 100% coverage distributions in seven select villages and towns—either their sites or closely neighboring villages. They conducted a pre-distribution census to figure out how many nets were needed, and collaboratively raised money on the Against Malaria website for 2,185 nets at the discounted price of $2 a net. They also conducted pre-distribution malaria talks at schools and markets in these select villages.</p>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/linguere_nets_02_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/linguere_nets_02_200.jpg" id="floatleft" border="0" /></a>However, after two major distributions in the area provided nets to all children under five in all towns and easily accessible villages in the department, the approach changed. At the urging of local health workers very familiar with malaria in the area, the Linguère-area volunteers decided to target extremely isolated rural populations who had not received nets in either of the previous two distributions. It was important to distribute to these people because had not received nets in the past, and also lack regular access to health structures where they might be able to purchase nets. In addition, volunteers and local health workers felt that it was important to target underserved populations to avoid the common problem of the hoarding or sale of excess nets. After consulting with workers at the Linguère hospital, volunteers decided to distribute to children under five and pregnant women, the two groups most severely affected by malaria.</p>
<p>To reach these rural populations, volunteers accompanied seven teams of health workers from Dodji, Labgar, Ouarkhokh, Gassane, Thiargny, Thiel and Linguère out into the bush over eight days during the national polio vaccine tours. Coordinating with the vaccination teams enabled volunteers to travel to regularly inaccessible areas of the bush and to easily identify children under five, all of whom received vaccines. The health workers assisted with the distributions and conducted short educational causeries in local languages.</p>
<p>A follow up survey of bed net use is desired; however, it will likely be difficult for volunteers to travel back out to these remote villages.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/linguere_nets_04_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/linguere_nets_04_200.jpg" id="floatright" border="0" /></a>2,185 children and/or pregnant women in seven health zones received nets during the distribution. Since most families in rural Senegal sleep two to five people on one bed, the nets will enable many more people—perhaps as many as 10,000 people—to prevent malaria during the upcoming rainy season.</p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>In targeting rural populations with minimal contact with volunteers and health workers, it became more difficult to conduct adequate education about the proper use of nets and other methods to prevent malaria. It’s also been more difficult to follow up, to ensure that the recipients are properly and regularly using their nets.</p>
<p>Additionally, it was difficult to reach highly isolated areas of the bush, and the coordination of transportation with the various health structures was at times problematic. Volunteers got stranded overnight in the bush on several occasions. Plans and schedules often changed because of lack of vehicles or vehicle problems, too.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>Volunteers have planned to make this collaborative bed net distribution an annual project. Each year, they will collaborate with health workers to strategically target different populations.</p>
