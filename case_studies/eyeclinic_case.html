<H1>Ophthalmology Mission in Kedougou</H1>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/eyeclinic_01_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/eyeclinic_01_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a>From March 9th - 20th a team of visiting American doctors, Right to Sight and Health, conducted an eye clinic at the regional hospital in Kedougou.  The main purpose of the clinic was to perform surgeries on patients blind from cataracts.  The mission was conducted at the regional hospital in Kedougou in cooperation with the local staff.  The mission was composed of two parts.  The first was the clinic, where patients with eye problems came for consultations.  In the clinic, patients were given free treatment if appropriate.  Candidates for cataract surgery were scheduled for a surgery in the operating room.  In the operation sector of the mission, pre-op, operations and post-op were conducted; as many as twelve surgeries a day were held.  Throughout the duration of the mission, 115 surgeries were performed and over 900 patients were consulted.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The American team was made up of four people: Dr. Donald Macdonald, Dr. Judith Simon,
Dr. Alexandra Vadasz and RN Hermina Whyte.  There were three representatives from the hospital who assisted daily for the duration of the mission: ophthalmology specialist Amadou Fall, anesthesiologist Mouhamed Sall and nurse Dura Keita.  On any given day there were around 10 Peace Corps volunteers assisting with the mission.  The head doctor of the region was extremely supportive and helpful in the success of the clinic.</p>
<p>Each day, in the OR, there was: one surgeon, the RN, one hospital staff, and three Peace Corps volunteers.  The other two doctors ran the clinic along with two Senegalese staff and up to seven PCVs.  In the clinic, consultations and advice was given regarding many different eye-problems, including: glaucoma, early cataract, eye-injury, floaters, headache, refractive error, presbypoia, pterygium, corneal scars, macular scars, dry eyes, ocular allergies, secondary membranes, aphakia and irreversible blindness.  Eyeglasses were distributed to people.  Patients blind in both eyes due to cataracts were given priority for surgery.  After the cataract surgery, 1 day post-op and 4 day post-op were conducted (when possible).  The doctors distributed antibiotic, steroid and anti-inflammatory eye drops for postoperative care and for some other ocular conditions.</p>
<p>With the exception of one Sunday, the clinic and OR was open every day from 8 in the morning with an hour break for lunch.  The clinic closed at 6 PM and the OR closed when the day’s scheduled surgeries were complete, anywhere from 5-9 PM.  The regional hospital was made available to us in any way that we needed.  The ‘bloc’ was used as the base for all operation related procedures, a large room and outside shade structure were used to house the clinic and beds in hospital room were available for post-op patients who lived far away.</p>

<h3>Promotion</h3>
<p>Radio was the main tool used to inform the population about the mission.  PCV Michele Lehman and her counterpart at the hospital, the responsible for health education, Karfa Keita, used his weekly health radio emissions as a way to inform the people of the upcoming clinic.  The announcements began a full two months before the clinic was scheduled to begin.  These advertisements on the radio also gave the people the opportunity to come into the hospital for pre-screening as requested by Dr. Simon.  The local specialist in ophthalmology, Mr. Fall performed these pre-screenings to identify potential candidates for surgery.  He also performed these screenings whenever his work took him out into the region.  In the days leading up to the mission special announcements were made by the community radio, to inform people of the impending mission.  One afternoon during the mission, two of the American doctors accompanied Keita to the radio station for his emission, where they promoted the mission and talked about the importance of eye care and exams.</p>
<h3>Community Contribution</h3>
<p>The mission provided free treatment and surgeries to patients.  Most all of the financial and technical contributions were made by the organization Right to Sight and Health.  However, the regional hospital of Kedougou and PCVs contributed enormously to the success of the mission.</p>
<p><ul>
<li>The hospital provided all of it services for free, that included the use of staff, facilities, electricity, equipment and some medical supplies.  Rooms were made available and patients were not charged for staying overnight at the hospital (a must for some of the patients who traveled long-distances)</li>
<li>PCVs were essential to the success of the mission.  2 were in the OR assisting as non-sterile scrub nurses, 1 did pre-op, 1 served as the scheduler of surgeries, the other 6 conducted eye exams, post-op and glasses distribution (each and every PCVs served as translators between locals and the American doctors)</li>
<li>Immensely helpful was Hassana Diallo who volunteered his time for the duration of the clinic to serve as a translator</li>
<li>The community radio emitted advertisements for the mission in the days leading to their arrival, at no cost</li>
</ul></p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/eyeclinic_02_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/eyeclinic_02_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" /></a>One of the main problems faced was the large number of patients arriving each day and the control of the crowds that ensued.  The offer of free medical treatment for a population so under-treated, in addition to the 100 plus people consulted by Fall beforehand, drove crowds of people to the mission’s door.  In the first hours of the mission there was confusion and misunderstanding as whether to exam people who came to the mission first, or people who Fall had pre-consulted and referred to the mission’s door.  It was decided to see people referred first.  Essential in implementing this in a culturally appropriate manner was the local nurse Dura Keita, who helped control the crowds for the duration of the mission.</p>
<p>The clinic and OR were often high-stress situations.  There were always crowds of people at the clinic: patients and their family members, lots of PCVs, American doctors and interested Senegalese staff; this often led to high-pressure atmosphere, where the smallest misunderstandings (which were numerous) could trip people.  The volunteers tried to remains calm and the American doctors would usually step back and realize they were stressing.  Some of the doctors found breaking out in song in front of the crowd as a good tactic to break tension.</p>
<p>The eye clinic was well promoted in the area surrounding Kedougou.  However the districts and thus people of other departments did not receive the message well in advance, if at all.  Michele repeatedly asked hospital administrators and Fall is the message had been passed and she was reassured it had been.  However, when a PCV in the Saraya area wanted to promote the clinic on the radio with the help of the local health district a week before the mission, he found that the district knew nothing about the mission.  In the future, more effort should be taken to spread the message in the areas furthest from the capital.</p>
<p>The electricity cut-out twice during the clinic.  We were assured beforehand that the backup generator worked, however it was discovered that after the cuts the generator had to be started manually.  This did not cause us a huge problem because we were not in the middle of surgery during a cut, but it could have. </p>
<h3>Successes</h3>
<p>There are many factors that helped make this a successful mission.</p>
<p><ul>
<li>PCVs commitment and dedication to the clinic.  For most of the PCVs this was a two-week, full-time commitment outside of their regular work as PCVs.  Many were convinced to help out at the last minute.  The American doctors relied on PCVs as nurses, assistants and translators and PCVs graciously filled these roles, remaining composed in a very high-pressure atmosphere.
</li>
<li>High number of patients treated.  People had to be turned away because there wasn’t enough time.  The radio was ESSENTIAL is passing the information of the mission in Kedougou.</li>
<li>The willingness of the local hospital and staff to support and facilitate the mission.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The patients, local hospital staff, American doctors and PCVs all seemed to be overall pleased with results of the mission.   Most patients wanted their second eye operated on!  Dr. Simon acknowledged that this was the most productive mission in her history of 13-missions; the 107 cataract sugeries performed by the Americans was the most performed in Right to Sight and Health’s history of missions.  The doctors were very impressed by the willingness and motivation of the local hospital and staff as well and the enthusiasm of volunteers.  They stated that they are eager to continue a partnership with Kedougou and hope to come back next year.</p>
