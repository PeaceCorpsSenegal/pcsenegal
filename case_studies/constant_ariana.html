<h1>Kaolack Moringa Intensive Cultivation Extension Program: Part I</h1>

<p>PCV Ariana Constant<br>
Kaolack Region <br>
July 7th – 12th 2011</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Between July 7th and 12th, thirty-three PCVs of all sectors (Agroforesry, Sustainable Agriculture, Urban Agriculture, Small Enterprise Development, Health and Environmental Education) in the Kaolack region undertook and completed the first of two parts of a region-wide initiative to explain and demonstrate both the agricultural and nutritional importance of Moringa oleifera. The targeted communities were chosen by the PCVs in the region based on previously demonstrated dedication and enthusiasm for Peace Corps and projects to improve nutrition and malnutrition in the selected communities, as well as improve on Host Country National (HCN) knowledge of agricultural best-practices for improving soil and best utilizing space for a specific purpose. The training targeted men, women and children in 22 communities throughout the three sub regions of Kaolack.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p><a href="photos/constant_1_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/constant_1_200.jpg" class="floatleft"></a>Kaolack region PCV Ariana Constant and PCV Carla Burns, both agroforestry volunteers, were invited to the Matam region in August 2010 to participate in a similar project lead by PCV Casey McConnell that targeted combating malnutrition in the youth population with Counterpart International (CI) an NGO based in the North of Senegal.  After a successful training where thirty-eight schools were impacted, Constant and Burns decided to attempt to apply a similar large-scale project in Kaolack. Without the help of an NGO like CI in the North, the PCVs drafted a project plan that suited the new conditions, empowering the volunteers in their region to conduct this large-scale exchange of knowledge on their own.</p>

<p>The main goal of the initiative was to educate, sensitize, and share knowledge about the importance of implementing appropriate agroforestry and sustainable agricultural technologies for improving food security and soil integrity through the utilization of Moringa oleifera and soil amendments, as well as increase knowledge regarding the nutritional and health benefits of Moringa and how to apply these principles to everyday life.</p>

<p><a href="photos/constant_2_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/constant_2_200.jpg" class="floatright"></a>Planning started in November of 2010, when the volunteers in Kaolack were asked if they wanted to participate in such a program. The interested PCVs then commenced the search for appropriate sites in which to conduct this training. Because the initiative was to be PCV organized and facilitated, volunteers were instructed to meet within their work-zones to select suitable sites. Each site selected was required to have one PCV responsible for facilitating and communicating with the community, a point of contact within the community, and a commitment to ensuring that the site would be adequately prepared on the day of the training.</p>

<p>Constant and Burns had initially budgeted both time and resources to complete twenty-four schools in six days, but due to lack of preparedness, or proper protection for the area in which we targeted to complete the intensive beds, we were only able to complete the training in twenty-two communities. There were 7 communities in the Kaffrine sub-region, 7 in the Fatik sub-region, and 8 in the Kaolack sub-region. The training was conducted in mostly Wolof, except for two Sereer communities.</p>

<p>Each community was required to provide basic tools, access to water, a well protected area, and adequate amounts of ash, manure, charcoal and fresh Azadirachta indica (neem) leaves to mix into the garden beds.</p>

<p>By May 2011, the sites had been selected, developed, and adequately prepped on what was to be expected for the training. By the next month, Peace Corps had approved the use of two cars for the project, and everything was in place to commence work.</p>

<h3>The Approach</h3>

<p>In each community, two 1 x 3 meter fully amended intensive Moringa oleifera beds with 10 cm uniform spacing and three trees for future seed sources were completed. PCVs near the selected sites lead the trainings targeting community health care workers, schoolteachers, parents, children, and anyone else within the community interested in learned about Moringa.</p>

<p>The technology extended for Part I of the training was called “double digging” and is typically used for breaking up hard soils so that tree and vegetables roots planted in the garden beds are more easily able to travel downward and bring up nutrients and water to the plants leaves and fruits. We also used garden amendments to improve the integrity and nutrient content of the soil. Per every 30 cm of garden bed we mixed in one shovel of manure, one shovel of neem leaves, ½ shovel of charcoal, and ½ shovel of ash. The soil was dug to approximately 30 cm.</p>

<p><a href="photos/constant_3_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/constant_3_200.jpg" class="floatright"></a>With the suggestion of a few Health PCVs in the region, we created four visual aids to help us convey the main points of the training. The first aid covered double digging, and how this technique impacts root growth. The second, fully-amending garden beds, and why the added nutrients are important for stimulating leaf growth and contributing to the general health of the saplings. The third, watering, stressing the importance of watering twice a day in the early mornings and late evenings. And lastly, bed maintenance, and the difference between intensive beds (focusing on maximizing leaf production), and fully mature trees (focusing on seed production).<p>

<p>With the help of 33 Kaolack PCVs, 2 Peace Corps cars, PC Staff Adama Coulibaly, and Driver Boubou Camara, we completed the 21 of the 22-targeted communities in six days. In each car there was one PCV responsible for facilitating the training and assuring that the proper material was covered and the driver. Because of the location of the sites, most PCVs met the PC car and volunteer facilitating, at the targeted site. Each day, each car covered two schools. Most were done by lunchtime, but if not, the participants ate lunch in the partner communities.</p>

<p>Because PC Senegal donated two cars and drivers, and the PCVs of Kaolack volunteered their time and expertise to conduct these training, the costs incurred were minima. We did write a grant to receive some minor backing from the Gardens of Moringa Fund, which included: cloth for visual aids, markers, and tools, in case a community did not have them.<p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p><a href="photos/constant_4_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/constant_4_200.jpg" class="floatleft"></a>Between July 7th and 12th, 21 out of the 24 communities initially targeted for this phase of the training were visited. The two communities were removed from the schedule due to lack of preparedness and lack of proper protection for the intensive beds to be prepared. One community had to be abandoned due to rain, but the PCV responsible for the site completed the seeding soon-after the initially planned date. This PCV and community, because of erosion problems, took a different approach to extending and seeding intensive Moringa beds. At this community, the PCVs seeded approximately 1000 seeds along a strip of land to help prevent future loss of soil and nutrients as the rainy season approaches.</p>

<p>At each school, the PCVs involved were required to record data pertinent to the site. We collected both qualitative and quantitative data on: demographics, important community members and their contact information, soil type and general environmental conditions, amendments used, problems encountered, suggestions for the future, and general comments.</p>

<p>Participants of the first phase of this initiative included: 292 women, 96 men and 249 boys and girls under 15-years of age. The location of the beds varied between communities; some took place in community gardens, some in school compounds. In general participation and enthusiasm were excellent, and we finished both beds and the tree planting. By the end of the training, 40 out of 44 beds were double dug, fully amended and seeded, and 18 out of 22 of the communities had planted three trees for future seed source.  Two of the communities did not have time to finish the second bed, and one additional community decided to seed in a strip to prevent erosion, instead of conducting a traditional training on how to complete an intensive bed.</p>

<p>There was also some resistance to planting trees for future seed source because a few communities already had many Moringa trees. The volunteers responsible for the communities who seemed hesitant are working in the coming weeks to explain to their communities the importance of having trees exclusively for seed collection.</p>

<p>In total over 10,000 Moringa seeds were put into the ground over the span of six days. The seeds were collected by PCVs, and therefore came at no cost. The amendments that the communities were required to have were also contributed. Due to its lack of dependency on money, a large-scale training of this type would be very easy to replicate in any region on the country, covering any topic.</p>

<h3>Next Steps </h3>

<p>In September, approximately six weeks after we seeded the intensive beds, the PCVs will be returning to the twenty-two targeted communities to conduct an additional training to address the nutritional benefits of Moringa oleifera and how process, store and apply the dried leaves into the Senegalese diet. Upon arrival we will assist the community members is cutting their Moringa intensive beds back to 30 cm in height from the 1.5 meters in height they should have grown to.</p>

<p>With the help of Health Education volunteers, we will strive to convey the importance of incorporating Moringa into the diets of both children and adults for improved health benefits. The same format will be applied. There will be two vehicles taking the PCVs to the targeted sites to conduct small-scale trainings using visual aids and tangible examples of how important Moringa oleifera is to consume.</p>
