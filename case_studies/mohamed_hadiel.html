<h1>Aram Subalo: Agricultural TOT</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>This was a one day semi-formal Agricultural Seminar led by PC Trainer Youssoupha Boye, covering two main subjects: Soil Improvements and Tree Care. The topics within these subjects included, but were not limited to: Zai holes, mulching, crop rotation, double digging, soil amenities (manure, Neem leaves, ash, etc), pesticides, compost, proper tree care, and tree transplanting. The seminar incorporated hands on demonstrations to increase the participants’ understanding.  The goal of this seminar was a training of trainers, hoping to spread the knowledge of better farming practices.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>A meeting was held with the village chief of Aram to choose the selected participants to attend this seminar, including a representative of two villages near Aram. Another meeting was held with a representative from the Community Rural of the larger town 6k from Aram, Medina Ndiatbe. The participants were chosen because of their roles in their villages/towns, and specifically choosing Presidents of various farming groups, women’s groups, hygiene groups, etc, promising the spread of knowledge. An important factor for holding seminars of this nature is to make sure the number of participants is limited, because of the hands on activities, exasperating amount of information being introduced,  and the number of questions that will be asked for clarification/farmer’s conflicts in their fields. The goal was 20 attendees, and we assumed that number would increase by word of mouth, to give us an estimated 30 attendees. There were 29 attendees; some traveling as far as 50k to attend.</p>

<p>The local Tostan Pulaar teacher was invited because of his ability to spread the knowledge to his alphabetization students; the regional Tostan representative also attended to help spread the knowledge to other Tostan teachers. The local NGO Counterpart International was also invited.  We felt it was  also important that the Village Chief attended to greet the participants.</p>

<p>The schedule was broken down into 2 broad categories: Soil Improvements, and Tree Care. Lessons included: zai holes, mulching, proper watering techniques (with water pumps), outplanting trees, tree nursery practices, using trees as wind breaks, companion planting, compost, double digging, and soil amenities.  We broke up the lectures with hands on demonstrations such as double digging: conduct 2 small sized seeded Moringa beds, one to be double dug, the other  to be prepared by a participant (using their traditional method).  The participants are therefore able to see the immediate physical difference when you push a stick into both beds and compare the depth; when watered properly they can notice the long term effects.</p>

<h3>The Approach</h3>

<p>Northern region PCVL, Casey, worked as a liaison with the Agriculture APCD, ultimately making it possible for to reserve Youssoupha’s time. Contact had been made a month in advance discussing the topics that Youssoupha should go over, including doing any necessary research for unfamiliar techniques. During this time appropriate meetings with: the village chief of Aram who recommended the attendees, Community Rural representative from Medina Ndiatbe who also gave me a list of attendees from Medina Ndiatbe, representatives from 2 surrounding villages.  Meetings were held with the potential attendees to discuss their roles and expectations following the completion of this seminar, and creating a list of issues they face in their fields so the lessons were applicable to their needs.  Next the date was selected; this created a deadline and was an essential piece of information when applying for the Peace Corps Small Projects Assistance (SPA) Grant. After the date was selected and the grant was submitted, participants were informed of the date, making sure to get a confirmation from the attendees that they would attend.  The SPA Grant covered costs for: pens, notebooks, certificates, lunch, and snacks.</p>

<p>The day before the seminar Youssoupha came to Aram, he viewed the venue for the seminar, made any comments of things he’d like to change. During this visit we made the final copy of the schedule going over all the lessons he’d address, and materials needed for the demonstrations.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>The 29 participants returned to their communities, and started implementing the techniques addressed during the seminar. When implementing the new techniques, others within the community will ask them questions leading to a perfect opportunity to share the knowledge. A large portion of participants were members of 26 groups/organizations within their communities including 8 womens’ groups ; this encourages the spread of knowledge to large masses of individuals. Since the training participants have been approaching PCVs to gain more knowledge about various topics that were discussed, participants are showing a larger interest in obtaining fruit tree seeds, and conducting their own tree nurseries.  The trainees are now confident trainers, making this a successful TOT.</p>

<h3>Next Step</h3>

<p>The goal to train other participants within the newly trained trainers communities will be conducted by staying in contact with the participants, holding an informal seminar, and/or open forum. This will allow them to train new participants, reinforce their knowledge, practice techniques, and encourage communities to share their knowledge about proper agricultural techniques. Creating demonstrational plots within the trainers’ fields will be a useful tool when holding informal seminars, and showing new participants implementation of new techniques.</p>
