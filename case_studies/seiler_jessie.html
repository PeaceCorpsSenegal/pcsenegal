<h1>Mosquito Net Distribution</h1>

<p>In partnership with many NGOs and the Senegalese Ministry of Health and Prevention, Peace Corps Volunteers participated in the effort to provide 100% coverage of impregnated mosquito nets in the Kaolack and Kaffrine regions. Our work was based on the fantastic efforts made by volunteers in the Kedougou, Kolda, Velingara, and Tambacounda regions, but we added our own particular peanut-region flair to it as well. Volunteers were active in two ways: they both assisted the Senegalese health structure in the actual work of the distribution, and also put on their own public health extravaganzas in large towns and cities across the region.</p>
<p>This distribution is remarkable not only for its scope and size, but also because the work rests almost entirely in the hands of Senegalese people themselves. Locals, on the village level, did the hardest work. Community health workers were responsible for completing a pre-distribution census, during which they determined the population’s need for mosquito nets. Each head of household was given a coupon specifying how many nets they would be receiving on the day of the distribution. Local and regional authorities verified these results, and then the mosquito nets were brought to centralized distribution points. Again, the local health workers stepped up for ten days of intense distribution activities. After the nets were all distributed, they also were responsible for checking that everyone had properly hung their nets up.</p>
<p>During these stages of the distribution, Peace Corps Volunteers helped out in their own communities by going along on the household visits and reinforcing the public health messages. Their participation was especially important for the behavior change components of the distribution, since their local knowledge and reputations as knowledgeable community members added credibility to the messages about malaria prevention. </p>
<p>The health shows Peace Corps Volunteers did in large towns throughout Kaolack and Kaffrine are known affectionately to them as “Louma Circuses.” A louma is a weekly market held in a central location, where people come to buy and sell their crops and many other items. These events are great opportunities for sharing public health messages. PCVs did neem lotion demonstrations, art contests, and malaria quizzes. They also featured music and theater spots in local languages about malaria. The theater spots are an especially fun way of communicating, because they are written and performed by local secondary school drama groups. Our particular talents as PCVs – making noise, getting attention, and getting people excited – become obvious assets at events like these. Men, women, and children all walk away from these programs with a reminder of how to protect themselves from malaria and why it’s important to do so. Besides, a good time is had by all.</p>
