<h1>Kouthia Ba Tree Nurseries</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The Peace Corps volunteer working in Kouthia Ba collaborated with local Eux et Foret agent, Diof, to execute a teaching seminar on the subject of tree nurseries. The seminar was hosted in Kouthia Ba and Payar (30 km north of Kouthia Ba), involving 10 womens’ groups and three schools.</p>
 
<h3>Context</h3>

<p><a href="photos/tree_stuff_1_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/tree_stuff_1_200.jpg" class="floatright"></a>Kouthia Ba is a primarily Wolof community of 1,335 inhabitants located 30 km from the road town of Koumpentoum.  In early 2009 Kouthia Ba was established as a Communaute Rural, and as of December 2009 a newly established laterite road extends from Koumpentoum, through Kouthia Ba and continues 30 km north to the community of Payar. With this rapid development it marks a time of great growth however it is more vital now than ever to increase the awareness of the balance between environmental protection and development. Diof and the PCV both arrived in Kouthia Ba in May of 2009. Community members approached both Diof and the PCV with concerns of increasing deforestation and depletion of soil. At the PCV’s PACA meeting community members expressed their interest in planting trees but did not have the knowledge to successfully carry out such a project. After it was evident that the community had a vested interest in reforestation activities Diof and the PCV met up to brainstorm about the most efficient way to convey information about tree nurseries to a large group of people.</p>

<h3>The Approach</h3>

<p>PCV found funding through a SPA training grant in order to provide food at the two trainings, transportation and watering cans. Eux et Foret donated the materials to construct the tree nurseries and Diof taught each seminar. Each women’s group chose three members and each school chose one teacher to attend the seminar. The first day of the seminar consisted of an informational session about the importance of trees and an interactive conversation about what the women and teachers already knew about the process of making tree nurseries and out-planting.  The second day consisted of a hands-on demonstration of making a tree nursery. At the end of the seminar each group was given 100 tree sacs, seeds, and a watering can.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p><a href="photos/tree_stuff_2_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/tree_stuff_2_200.jpg" class="floatright"></a>Every women’s group successfully passed on the information to their fellow members and created a tree nursery. After each nursery was planted, Diof and the PCV visited each nursery to re-distribute seeds to re-plant and give suggestions on how to improve their nurseries. Unfortunately only one school group successfully created a nursery. The women out-planted their trees in fields or as live-fencing for already existing fields.</p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>

<p>When the PCV and Diof were monitoring the nurseries it was easy to keep updated on all the different groups’ progress. However once the women began to out-plant it was difficult to make sure the women were doing the job effectively. It was also a challenge to get the schools involved and motivated. The season for planting tree nurseries coincides with the end of the school year and exams which made it difficult for teachers to find the time and effort to add another activity.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p><a href="photos/tree_stuff_3_640.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/tree_stuff_3_200.jpg" class="floatright"></a>Next time it would be more effective if a second seminar was done just before out-planting season. Even though the women were motivated to out-plant the trees there were issues with their knowledge to carry out the task to the best of their ability.</p>
