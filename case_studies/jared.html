<H1>Womens' Garden</H1>

<h3>Summary</h3><p><img src="photos/thumbs/jared1.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" />A Peace Corps volunteer worked with the village’s women’s group to design and
implement a community garden in the village. The garden was used to teach improved
and sustainable gardening practices as well as provide the women’s group with a source
of income to fund other projects. </p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p><img src="photos/thumbs/jared2.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" />The Medina Ndiobene Women’s Group includes 70 adult women from the village.
Before the garden, they had experience working on successful initiatives together such as
mosquito net distributions and a nutrition project aimed at encouraging the incorporation
of beans into meals. The group has many projects planned for the village but mostly
relies on donations from members to fund the projects.</p>

<p>PCV Jared Graeve (2008-2011) met with the group to brainstorm ways to generate
income for the group. A garden fit the expressed needs. Rather than solicit donations
from community members for their projects, the women could sell produce harvested
from the garden and turn a profit. The garden would greatly increase the amount of
available fresh vegetables in the community and in turn improve the overall nutrition of
the community members.</p>  

<h3>The Approach </h3>
<p><img src="photos/thumbs/jared3.jpg" id="floatleft" border="0" />First, the PCV and the women’s group selected an appropriate site for the garden. Space,
availability of water, and accessibility were all taken into consideration before the
selection was made. Once the site was chosen, the volunteer and the group prepared a
budget that accounted for fencing around the gardening site and all the tools necessary
to do gardening work. Funding from the USAID/Peace Corps Senegal Food Security
Initiative offset the start up cost. Members of the group and other villagers provided all
the labor to fence in the gardening site.</p>

<p>After the site was fenced in, the volunteer began teaching the women improved and
sustainable gardening techniques. The women learned how to “double-dig” they beds,
the benefits of adding various soil amendments, and proper spacing of plants. They
also started a tree nursery for fruit trees in their garden and a live fence around it.</p>

<p>The women designated several group leaders who were put in charge of weeding and
watering groups. These task groups were assigned a schedule to ensure the garden was
well watered and weed free.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>The women learned about improved and sustainable gardening techniques and basic
tree propagation and care. Subsequently, many of the women took what they learned in
the garden and started their own personal gardens. They have also managed to sell the produce from the garden providing income for the women’s group.</p>

<h3>Next Steps </h3>
<p>Money from the produce will be reinvested in the garden in order to increase
productivity. The group plans on building concrete basins to fill with and take water from
in the garden, greatly decreasing effort and time spent watering. The group also plans on
incorporating more agroforestry techniques in the garden, such as doing tree grafting and
establishing a wind break in order to protect all the plants. Most importantly, the garden
will continue to produce vegetables and generate income for the group.</p>
