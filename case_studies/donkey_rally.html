<h1>The Kolda Donkey Rally: Promoting Moringa Oleifera to End Child Malnutrition</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p><a href="photos/donkey_1_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/donkey_1_200.jpg" class="floatright"></a>The main goal of this project was to improve the nutritional status of Kolda residents, particularly children, by improving the capacity of Kolda residents to grow and cook more nutritious foods, with a focus on the cultivation and consumption of Moringa Oleifera. The participatory, question-and-answer style causeries covered basic food groups, a balanced diet, the nutritional benefits of Moringa, and Moringa cooking options. In addition, PCVs distributed Moringa seeds to participating audience members. With the participation of 18 local health workers and 17 Kolda Region PCVs, 12 comprehensive nutrition causeries were performed over 6 days along RN 6 from Kounkane to Kolda, from March 9 ñ 14, 2011. In order to attract public attention and interest in the project, 4 participating volunteers rode/walked donkeys the entire route, approximately 100 km.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>The donkey rally and nutrition causeries took place in the Departments of Velingara and Kolda in the Region of Kolda, specifically in 12 road towns along RN 6 from Kounkane to Kolda. Malnutrition, particularly child malnutrition, is a major problem in the Kolda region. 50.8% of Senegalese are classified as poor and live on less than 2400 calories per day, and 17% of children under 5 years of age suffer from malnutrition. This is especially devastating given that, like the rest of Senegal, the population is very young, with over half the population under 25 years old. The vast majority of the population is employed in subsistence agriculture which focuses primarily on grain production. Nutritious fruits, vegetables, and proteins are a rarity.</p>

<p>Because the Kolda region suffers from high rates of malnutrition, and because most families lack the disposable income necessary to purchase expensive nutritious food for their families, it is necessary to find affordable alternatives that can improve the nutritional status of Kolda residents. Therefore, the priority in this project was to extend affordable and practical nutrition options to Kolda residents, with a focus on the cultivation and consumption of Moringa Oleifera, which is cheap, easy to grow, and readily available locally.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>

<p>After extensive interviews with Kolda residents and health workers, PCVs Geoffrey Burmeister and David Shames determined that finding affordable ways to fight malnutrition, particularly child malnutrition, was a high priority in Kounkane, given the high incidence of malnutrition and the lack of disposable income among the general population. They determined that a series of short causeries encouraging simple improvements in nutrition, and particularly emphasizing the cultivation and use of Moringa Oleifera, was the best strategy for fighting malnutrition in Kolda.</p>

<p><a href="photos/donkey_2_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/donkey_2_200.jpg" class="floatleft"></a>Perhaps the most important question to ask regarding the Kolda Donkey Rally is: why donkeys? While the Kolda region is characterized by poverty and poor overall health, it is no stranger to health causeries. Due to the heavy NGO presence in the area and the prevalence of ìdime-a-dozenî causeries, PCVs feared that similar causeries might not draw the attention required to adequately extend practical and affordable nutrition practices. Therefore, Kolda PCVs decided that the novelty and ingenuity of a team of volunteers and relais riding donkeys and bicycles from Kounkane to Kolda, performing simple causeries at all major road towns, was a surefire way to attract large-scale attention to the cause of ending malnutrition in the Kolda region, and local health workers and government functionaries overwhelmingly agreed. PCVs David Shames and Geoffrey Burmeister then worked with their community counterparts and Kounkane health relais Moustafa Diallo to obtain pricing for the labor and materials for the series of nutrition causeries. PCVs personally financed all costs related to the donkeys and food, and lodging was provided free of charge by Kolda PCVs and local health posts. Kolda PCVs also traveled to all planned stops along RN 6 to obtain permission to perform the causeries from local authorities and functionaries, and to solicit the participation of local health relais in performing the causeries.</p>

<p>In order to improve the overall sustainability of the project, Kolda PCVs determined that local health relais would lead all of the causeries within their communities, facilitated by Kounkane relais Moustafa Diallo. This improves the likelihood that communication skills and knowledge of healthy nutrition practices will be transferred to members of all affected communities and eliminates any potential language barriers. PCV Burmeister collaborated with Kounkane relais Moustafa Diallo to prepare a simple Pulaar and French carte fiche outlining the order of activities for the nutrition causeries, which was distributed to all participating health relais by Kolda PCVs. PCVs routinely followed up with participating health relais and local officials to prepare causerie activities and publicize the causeries through word-of-mouth advertisement and radio spots, including a half-hour segment on Tewdu FM Diaobe (94.0). PCV Burmeister also prepared a series of large visual aids representing the three basic food groups (go, glow, and grow foods), and the important vitamins and minerals in Moringa oleifera.</p>

<p>PCVs Shames and Burmeister also recognized that the novelty of the donkey ride would attract significant attention from family, friends, and acquaintances back home. After discussions with Peace Corps Senegal administration, they decided to heavily publicize the event through emails, blogs, and an online promotional video, which was filmed and posted in January 2011, in order to solicit donations towards a special section of the Peace Corps Senegal Country Fund devoted to small-scale gardening and nutrition projects (to be reviewed in a future case study).</p>

<p>Over 6 days, 12 comprehensive nutrition causeries were performed in the following road towns:</p>

<p>In terms of participants:</p>
<ul>
	<li>813 people (271 men, 542 women) attended the causeries.</li>
	<li>13 health relais and 5 ICPs participated in leading the causeries, organizing the logistics of the causeries, and publicizing the events.</li>
	<li>4 Kolda PCVs rode/walked donkeys the entire journey from Kounkane to Kolda, and 13 PCVs accompanied some or all of the tour on bicycle.</li>
</ul>

<p>The causeries were performed in question-and-answer format, and covered the following topics:</p>
<ul>
	<li>What is malnutrition?</li>
	<li>What are the dangers of malnutrition?</li>
	<li>The size of the problem of malnutrition in Senegal</li>
	<li>The importance of breastfeeding exclusively until a child is 6 months old</li>
	<li>The importance of eating 5-6 times per day</li>
	<li>The 3 basic food groups (go, glow, grow) and the importance of a diversified diet</li>
	<li>The nutritional content of Moringa oleifera</li>
	<li>How to properly prepare and cook Moringa oleifera</li>
</ul>

<p>Some causeries also featured a comedic sketch performed by PCVs related to child malnutrition.</p>

<p><a href="photos/donkey_3_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/donkey_3_200.jpg" class="right"></a>Because the causeries were led by local health relais and focused on simple, affordable ways to improve child nutrition, and because of the relatively large numbers of participants at each causerie, this project helped improve Kolda residentsí capacity to provide a diverse diet of nutritious foods for their children, and also expanded understanding of the incredible nutritional potential of Moringa oleifera. More specifically, the causeries stressed that even in poor areas that lack disposable income, it is possible to grow and eat all of the foods necessary to maintain a healthy diet. And because the causeries included a heavy focus on audience participation, it is expected that all community members will feel an increased sense of empowerment to eat better and improve their nutritional status.</p>

<p>In addition, the 13 participating health relais received in-depth training on nutrition education. The experience of conducting participatory causeries allowed health relais to practice and strengthen their skills and improve their confidence to conduct such participatory preventative health education activities in the future, both in formal settings and informally when spending time with their neighbors, friends, and family.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>By increasing awareness of affordable nutrition options, including Moringa oleifera, among communities along RN 6 from Kounkane to Kolda, it is expected that community members will improve their nutritional status and provide their children with more diverse and nutritious foods. Because the causeries were led by local health relais who live and work in their communities, they are likely to remain in contact with audience members and can continue to informally educate their peers on improving nutrition. Also, given the large audience turnout and overall success of the project, it is hoped that local health workers will be influenced to perform similar causeries in the future.</p>

<p>At the end of the causeries, many audience members wanted more information on how to cultivate Moringa oleifera in their homes. While these causeries covered mostly the nutritional aspect of Moringa, a future tour of Moringa intensive leaf bed trainings for womenís groups in these same communities could be very beneficial in improving the nutritional status of Kolda area communities.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Kolda Donkey Rally attracted significant fundraising from the United States, which will be used via the Gardens of Moringa Fund to provide financing of up to 75,000 CFA for all PC Senegal volunteers for Moringa intensive bed trainings, small-scale gardening projects, and improving garden technologies.</p>

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>

<p>Overall, the nutrition causeries were a huge success. The local relais did a fantastic job of leading the causeries and keeping the discussion on track, and local audience members actively participated in answering questions and providing commentary. The relais and PCVs ultimately discovered that by carefully leading questions, they could use audience responses to smoothly transition from topic to topic and improve information retention among audience members.</p>

<p><a href="photos/donkey_4_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/donkey_4_200.jpg" class="floatleft"></a>The most important lesson learned during this project was that in organizing causeries, it is important to focus on a target audience. For nutrition causeries, the target audience is women, particularly young mothers, who are culturally tasked with caring for small children. At causeries attended by specifically invited representatives of local womenís groups, the program ran much smoother and the information was better retained than at causeries that were haphazardly organized and including random passers-by. For some health topics (particularly HIV/AIDS), it is beneficial to perform causeries in large public places frequented by youth, but for a topic such as malnutrition, it is better to focus on a narrow target audience of young mothers.</p>

<p>Another important finding was that although the donkey rally aspect of the project attracted a lot of attention and fundraising among friends and family in the United States for the Gardens of Moringa fund (to be reviewed in a future case study), riding donkeys had a minimal impact on attracting local audience participants. While people along RN 6 found the idea of PCVs riding donkeys funny and unique, it did not incline them to attend the causeries if they were not already interested. Therefore, in the future, if the goal of the project is only to perform health causeries, and not to attract attention or facilitate fundraising in the United States, it is better to stick to more simple (and less painful) modes of transportation.</p>

<p>It is also important to be realistic when planning stops along a causerie tour, particularly with a mode of transportation as unreliable as donkeys. While PCVs had initially planned to perform 13 causeries, they were forced to eliminate one stop because of time and weather constraints. In addition, it is advisable not to perform a causerie tour during the hot season from March to May. Performing 12 causeries over 6 days is exhausting enough, even without having to walk 20 km per day in 115 degree heat.</p>

<p>Also, PCVs found that it was sometimes difficult to get female relais to help lead the causeries and speak publicly, particularly if there was also a male relais present. In the future, when planning causeries, female relais need to be specially prepped to lead discussions, preferably separately from male relais, in order to ensure their participation. Expecially in regards to malnutrition, where the target audience is young women, the discussion could be much more beneficial and realistic for audience members if it were led by a female relais.</p>
