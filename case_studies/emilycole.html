<H1>Mosquito Net Distribution</H1>

<p><b>Hamady Baga, Ouro Baaba Ly and Guedel Comi<br />
December 22-24, 2009</b></p>

<h3>Summary</h3><p>PCV Emily Cole, Infirmier Chef du Post de Diambo Soubalo, Mamadou Diome, and community health workers Ibrahim Mall, Yassine Ndiaye, Mariam Ba, and Binta Mall partnered with Against Malaria and the Ministry of Health to address the problem of malaria in the villages surrounding the health post in Diambo Soubalo (population ~2000).   Their activities included hosting malaria education events, surveying bed-net usage, and distributing 444 long-lasting insecticide-treated nets.</p>

<h3>Preparation</h3>

In the rainy season, community health workers encouraged people to drain all standing water in the communities.  Unfortunately, the villagers were not responsive to this tactic.  To build on these activities, during the October 2009 national bed-net distribution to children under age 5, the health workers conducted home-visits to encourage repairs to torn mosquito nets, as well as provide information on proper use and caring for insecticide-treated nets.</p>
<p>The week before the distribution, Emily Cole, Ibrahim Mall and Binta Mall conducted house-to-house surveys of net usage and availability.  Binta Mall explained to beneficiaries the importance of accurate information on the number of beds and number of people in the house. To avoid the cultural taboo of counting individuals in the households, we wrote lists of names to get an accurate count.</p>  
<p>Diambo Soubalo and Goude Comi had received nets for children under 5 years two months before. The other two small villages had not received any nets.  Their net coverage was very low, and many people had old, torn, or irreparable nets. During each visit, the health volunteers emphasized the importance of sleeping under bed nets, especially for pregnant women and children.</p>

<h3>Distribution</h3>
<p>The distribution began in Diambo Soubalo on December 22, 2009. PCV Jaime Bodden joined Emily Cole and the health workers for the first day of the distribution. One team member opened all of the bags and divided them into groups for each household. The other health workers acted as runners, taking the bundles of nets to individual houses. The health workers then double-checked the number of nets received with the number of beds, while reviewing use and care of the nets. They emphasized that nets should be used throughout the year, even when there are few mosquitoes and/or when sleeping indoors.  The volunteers also reminded people not to wash their nets more than a few times per year.</p>

This herding community is removed from most government servicing, having neither a health hut nor a primary school. Community members were eager to receive the nets, as they had not been covered in the national distribution, and mosquito nets had not been available in the markets for several months.</p>
<p>The following day, Ibrahim Mall and Emily Cole took a horse cart with 90 nets to Ouro Baaba Ly and Goudel Comi. Ouro Baaba Ly is a small village of only four households. They met with each household and distributed the nets. The same approach was used in the leper colony of Goudel Comi. These two villages are often overlooked in health activities and were very appreciative of the nets. Neither village had received nets in the national distribution. That Friday, the village of Goudel Comi held a meeting to pray for the people who provided them with mosquito nets.</p>

<h3>Follow-Up and Evaluation</h3>
<p>In the days immediately following the distribution, Emily Cole returned to all houses in each community to ensure that people were using the nets and that none had been resold. No nets have shown up at the local markets. There were some complaints and demands for more nets, but far less than anticipated. All communities were happy with the distribution and were thrilled to “spend the entire night in peace” undisturbed by mosquitoes and flies.The health workers checked to make sure that nets were hanging inside the houses.</p> 
<p>In February, Emily Cole revisited each community to see if people were still using the nets. All of the nets were still in use, although people asked for additional nets to take with them when they camp in their fields during harvest time.</p>
<p>Emily Cole spoke to individual households about the importance of reducing standing water and planted trees outside of four showers in Diambo Soubalo where water was pooling. She will check on the planted trees in April.</p>
<p>It is not yet malaria season in the area, so as of yet there is no new data on malaria rates. Malaria rates in this area are generally low, so any change may not be statistically significant.</p>
