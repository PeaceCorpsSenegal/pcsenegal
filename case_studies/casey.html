<H1>Intensive Moringa Olifera Cultivation</H1>

<h3>Summary</h3><p><a class="gallery" href="photos/Neb4_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/thumbs/Neb4_200.jpg" id="floatright" border="0" /></a>Peace Corps Senegal partnered with Counterpart International (CPI) to plant intensive <a href="?page=case_studies/moringa.html">Moringa oliefera</a> beds in 38 communities across the region of Matam in northern Senegal.  The region faces serious child malnutrition and rapidly declining tree populations (particularly the species Moringa).  An area PCV approached CPI to partner with Peace Corps and conduct a large scale planting and promotion of Moringa to prevent and reduce child malnutrition. CPI recommended the project be implemented in communities in which they currently carry out the Food for Education Program, which includes school gardens, nutritional education, and a school lunch program.</p>
<p>Over the course of seven days, the two organizations visited the communities and trained participants to plant intensive moringa beds in improved soils. Through the demonstration, communities built two six square meter beds. Three months after the first training, Peace Corps will return to the communities to teach best practices for harvesting and utilizing the nutritious leaves.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/Neb1_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/thumbs/Neb1_200.jpg" id="floatleft" border="0" /></a>The primary consideration was how best to extend Moringa to a large number of communities for the prevention and reduction of child malnutrition. The partners agreed on intensive Moringa cultivation, a technique that maximizes leaf yield for regular consumption by planting many trees in deeply aerated, nutrient amended garden beds. Once productive, the tree beds would serve in a demonstration of how both fresh and dried Moringa leaves can be added to local dishes to prevent and reduce child malnutrition.  </p>
<p>The 48 targeted communities ranged from small villages to large towns, and were ethnically Pulaar, with the exceptions of one Wolof village and one Sarakhoulé village.</p>

<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/Neb3_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/thumbs/Neb3_200.jpg" id="floatleft" border="0" /></a>The project’s main focus was the seven days of hands-on trainings to build intensive moringa beds and two Moringa trees for seed production in 48 communities. The trainings were conducted at a variety of locations based upon the resources of each individual community. These sites included elementary and middle schools, health posts, compounds of community leaders, and water sources.</p>
<p>Preparing the communities before the training day was essential. The organizers asked each community to prepare certain tasks before the day. They measured two 6m x 1m plots and dig the soil there to a depth of 20-30cm. Additionally, they procured materials to be used as soil amendments as prescribed by the bio-intensive, “double digging” technique including two full rice sacs of green materials (preferably Neem leaves), three full rice sacs of manure (preferably cow manure), one-half rice sac of wood ash, and one-half rice sac of bio-char. CPI facilitators traveled to each community during the weeks leading up to the project, both to evaluate site suitability and communicate the necessary preparations as stated. </p>

<p>Area PCVs coordinated with CPI and planned the technical agricultural aspects, identifying and taking into account required community resources needed for success. These included land, protection from animals and livestock, a reliable water source, the motivation to learn and adopt a new agricultural technique, and the manpower to perform the required long-term maintenance. The week of the training, Peace Corps contributed the labor of eight PCVs experienced in intensive Moringa cultivation, Moustapha Ndiaye (a PC Urban Agriculture Counterpart and native of Matam), PC Volunteer Support Assistant Tidiane Diao, over 40,000 viable Moringa seeds, and two PC vehicles. </p>
<p>CPI took responsibility for identifying interested communities that already participated in the Food for Education Program and for managing all communication to those communities on behalf of the project.  Over a four month period, CPI facilitators made site visits to ensure that each community had in place the required resources. They briefed community leaders on the goals and benefits of the project, namely the Moringa leaf’s potential as a nutritional supplement and its immense value in combating child malnutrition. For the training, CPI contributed the assistance of six facilitators familiar with the targeted communities, one vehicle, and a much-appreciated per diem to cover the cost of food for the eight PC volunteers. </p> 

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/Neb5_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/thumbs/Neb5_200.jpg" id="floatright" border="0" /></a>To execute the trainins, the PC volunteers, staff and CPI facilitators created four teams.  Each team conducted two intensive Moringa cultivation trainings per day at two communities as geographically convenient to each other as possible.  To account for unseen variables and difficulties, it was agreed that both parties commit to the project a time commitment of eight days. Upon their arrival to the proposed implementation site, each team assessed whether or not the existing fencing was sufficient, as well as presence of a reliable water source.  In four instances, upon realizing that one or both of these resources were insufficient, teams worked with the host community to relocate the training to a more suitable compound.  </p>

<p>These trainings were PCV-led, and attended by community leaders, health care workers, school teachers, the proposed gardener or caretaker, as well as any interested men, women and children of the general community.  The improved, bio-intensive farming technique known as “double digging” was extended. After demonstrating the technique through about two repetitions, the training participants from the host community would take over all labor, while team members would simply monitor.  Team members put a special emphasis on instructing one to two individuals, then challenging them to instruct their peers in attendance. </p> 

<p>This project was very low-input, aside from transportation costs, which Peace Corps and CPI shared. The community contribution did not include monetary expenses.  Communities were selected because they already had certain resources like secure fencing, a year-round reliable water source, a caretaker or gardener for future maintenance, and some tools.  The organic materials they were asked to provide as bed amendments are all locally available at no cost.  Peace Corps' Kaolack Region provided over 40,000 viable Moringa seeds, which were collected at no cost.  </p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/Neb2_700.jpg"><img src="photos/thumbs/Neb2_200.jpg" id="floatleft" border="0" /></a>The project successfully involved the participation of 188 men, 111 women, 170 boys (17 years and under), and 91 girls (17 years and under). Just prior to the start date, CPI decided to cancel five communities because they could not meet project requirements. So, when the project began on August 16, the trainers planned to reach 43 of the proposed 48 communities.  Ultimately, the project plan was implemented at 38 of the attempted 43 communities.  Of the five abandoned communities, one was left because of inaccessibility due to bad weather, one due to insufficient fencing, one because of non-working a water source, and two because they were completely unprepared and/or non-present upon arrival.  </p>

<p>In order to measure success and provide information for follow up, each team was charged with recording data describing community participation, preparedness, motivation, and overall comprehension of the training’s content. This data was both quantitative and qualitative. </p>

<p>Overall, community preparedness, attendance, and motivation ranged from good to excellent.  Only one site out of 38 was described as “unprepared,” meaning they had not procured the needed materials prior to the team’s arrival.  Only five of 38 were noted for poor attendance and motivation, meaning that they were either not participating in the physical labor, or only had one to two community members in attendance.  The qualitative data recorded by each team was also generally positive.  Team members often reported that training participants showed good to excellent comprehension of the bio-intensive, “double digging” technique. </p>

<p>In the end, 47.5 beds were prepared and seeded.  This fell short of the original goal to prepare and seed two beds per community.  Mid-morning on the first day of the tournée, it was agreed that the training plan be adjusted; each team would prepare and seed only one bed per community.  This ensured that the trainings would not be rushed, and that the proper attention to detail was paid during instruction of the bio-intensive, “double digging” technique. More than one bed was prepared and seeded at 10 sites. Every community which hosted a training thoroughly prepared and seeded at least one bed, and planted at minimum two individual Moringa trees somewhere inside or nearby the training site for a future seed supply.  </p>

<p>For the purpose of adaptive research, each team planted one half of each bed at 10 cm spacing and one-half at 20 cm spacing.  During the second phase of the project, PCV’s will record data to measure which spacing provides a better overall yield considering soil type. 
</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>In November of 2010, approximately two and a half months after the trainings will have occurred, a team of eight PCVs and CPI facilitators will implement the project’s next phase.  The next phase of the project consists of conducting trainings on how to harvest and utilize Moringa leaves to prepare a highly nutritious powder to be added to traditional Senegalese dishes.  An emphasis will be placed on communicating the powder’s benefits to pregnant women, mothers who are nursing, and children under five. The November tournée will also ask each team to record follow up information to measure the first tournée’s success, which tree spacing produces the higher yield,  and assess the project’s impact and sustainability. </p>
