<H1>Junior Achievement in Nioro du Rip, Senegal</H1>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><img src="photos/thumbs/IMG_3333.JPG" id="floatright" height="150px"/>From May 5 to June 2 2010, PCV Elizabeth Corkery led a Junior Achievement class for 50 students at the École Primaire Saër Maty Bâ in Nioro du Rip, Senegal. Students engaged in weekly, hands-on lessons taught in French by the volunteer. The goal of the program was to foster awareness and understanding of the economic opportunities and responsibilities people face in Nioro. Over the five weeks, concepts covered included community, production, government, business decision-making and money. The program was a great success and the PCV and her work partners plan to expand it to other schools in Nioro over the next school year.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Young children in Senegal are not typically exposed to education related to business and economics. Thus, having worked with Junior Achievement in America, Elizabeth felt the program represented a unique opportunity to inspire the youth in her community to succeed in today’s global economy. In conjunction with Junior Achievement Senegal and l’Inspection Départemental de l’Education de Nioro (Education Inspection Office for the Department of Nioro), the volunteer worked to bring Junior Achievement’s “Our Community” curriculum to the students at Saër Maty Bâ. Alioune Fall, the volunteer’s counterpart and a teacher at Saër Maty Bâ, chose 50 of the school’s brightest students between the ages of 9 and 12 to participate in the program.</p>

<p>As a Small Enterprise Development (SED) volunteer, Elizabeth works to educate and build capacity for individuals, businesses and organizations. This class addressed two specific goals from the SED project plan: Establishing contacts between local community members and non-governmental organizations; and Facilitating classes for youth on business basics.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p><img src="photos/thumbs/IMG_3330_2.JPG" id="floatright" height="150px"/>The class consisted of five lessons covering the following topics:
<ol>
	<li>How a community works
    	<ul>
        	<li>The focus of this lesson was on understanding the concept of community and identifying the various job opportunities available in Nioro</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>Production strategies
    	<ul>
        	<li>Imagining they were workers at a bakery, the students practiced with and discussed the concepts of production and specialization and division of labor</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>The role of government
    	<ul>
        	<li>Students learned about the economic role of government in their community. Specific emphasis was put on the goods and services government provides, as well as the concept of taxes</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>The decision-making process
    	<ul>
        	<li>The class was given three different business ideas and faced with the decision of which business to open in Nioro. They discussed the pros and cons of each option relative to the community’s wants and needs. A vote was then taken to determine which business would be best for their community</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>The movement of money
    	<ul>
        	<li>Using examples from their daily lives, the students learned about the circular flow of money in the economy</li>
        </ul></li>
</ol>

<p>All 50 students were given copies of Junior Achievement’s “Our Community” curriculum in French to help them follow along with the lessons. The volunteer provided other resources needed for hands-on activities.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Throughout the course of the program, the students at Saër Maty Bâ showed great enthusiasm and understanding of the concepts covered. At the end of the five weeks, a reception was held at the school for the students and their parents. Certificates of achievement were given to each student to recognize their participation and success. This class introduced talented youth from the community of Nioro to economic concepts and started them thinking about opportunities for their future from a young age.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p><img src="photos/thumbs/HPIM2483.JPG" id="floatleft" height="150px"/>After the success of introducing Junior Achievement at Saër Maty Bâ, the volunteer and her work partners are expanding the program to other schools in Nioro and the surrounding area. Their hope is that once the program has been started at a school, the local teaching staff will takeover and continue to implement it independently. Overall, Junior Achievement represents an excellent opportunity for communities throughout Senegal to have a sustainable impact on their future businessmen and women.</p>

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>One key to the class’s success was student selection: 50 of the school’s top students were chosen to participate. These students demonstrated through their good grades that they are motivated to do well in school and thus, were more likely to participate well. Selecting students based on academic achievement allows participating in Junior Achievement to be billed as a privilege, creating both a reward for current participants and a goal for future students. Additionally, lessons need to be prepared well in advance of class time. Preparation is crucial as certain examples or concepts in the lessons, which were originally designed to be taught in Europe, need to be changed to better reflect the realities of life in Senegal. Finally, have a Senegalese counterpart present during lessons to allow them to learn the interactive way in which Junior Achievement is meant to be taught and prepare them to continue the classes in the future.</p>
