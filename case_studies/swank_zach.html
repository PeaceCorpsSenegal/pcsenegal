<h1>Canary Water Filter Case Study</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><a href="photos/swank_1_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/swank_1_200.jpg" class="floatright"></a>In an effort to reduce water born diseases and increase business opportunities for small enterprises I adapted a locally available, inexpensive water filter into a canary (clay pot) system. A local entrepreneur in Dakar was trained by a NGO to import ceramic candle filters from Brazil and assemble low cost filter units for about $30 USD. The filters are effective but not attractive to consumers due to the simple plastic buckets that are used to house them. My contribution was to replace the plastic buckets with a more sustainable and elegant container: local clay canaries. Canaries are commonly found throughout Senegal and are used to cool drinking water, a benefit they also confer to the filter units. The canary filters that I produced went exclusively to the Segou “Luuro Pelle” Ecotourism Lodge. However, they were attractive enough that they could be marketed widely in Senegal.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p><a href="photos/swank_2_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/swank_2_200.jpg" class="floatleft"></a>According to the UN in 2009 over a quarter of the population of Senegal still did not have access to clean drinking water. However, even the “clean” drinking water can pose a problem due to contamination of pipes that are left open to aspirate with the municipal water supply is not adequate or from the contamination of wells. Ceramic candle filters are a cheap and cost effective means of combating water born illnesses for families in cities and villages alike. However, candle filters are not used as widely in Senegal as they are in other parts of the developing world, most notably South America. In Senegal the use of the filters suffers from a lack of availability and publicity about their effectiveness. Entrepreneurs are starting to import them from abroad but without a serious promotion campaign, most Senegalese are unaware of their benefits. However, there is no question about the quality of the filters available.</p>

<p>A comparative study between a variety of ceramic candle filters, including the low cost filters imported into Senegal and the top of the line British Birkfield filters, showed very little statistical difference between the performance of the filters. The $4 USD filters imported from Brazil work just as well as the $40 USD filters made in the UK. The study, titled “A Performance Study of Ceramic Candle Filters in Kenya,” can be found on the MIT.edu website.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p><a href="photos/swank_3_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/swank_3_200.jpg" class="floatright"></a>When I first came across a locally assembled water filter I immediately contacted the entrepreneur to discuss ways we could increase the utilization of water filters in Senegal. We discussed many ideas, however our collaboration was hampered by the fact that we lived at different ends of the country. In the end, I was not able to develop a marketing strategy with him as I had hoped to, however I did demonstrate how to make the canary water filters.</p>

<p>The process of assembling the filters was fairly straightforward. I bought two canaries and used an electric drill to pierce holes in one canary for the ceramic candle filters and a hole in the other canary for the water faucet. The first canary was then set on top of the second.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>As hoped, the resulting canary filters were appealing enough to be marketable both on their usefulness and attractiveness. This opens up a whole new market for the locally produced filters in Senegal. They also cooled the water while filtering it and still cost around $30 USD.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p><a href="photos/swank_4_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/swank_4_200.jpg" class="floatleft"></a>At this moment no next steps are planned although the entrepreneur could benefit from marketing and business trainings. Another possibility would be to aid the entrepreneur to set up a network of distributers around Senegal, increasing peoples access to clean water while helping the entrepreneur’s business grow at the same time. Anyone wishing to contact the entrepreneur can reach him through the current PC Senegal Ecotourism PTA, Amar Sall.</p>

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>Not all canaries are appropriate for the canary filters. If they are too thick it becomes difficult to attach the ceramic candle filters and faucet. Canaries that leak to the point that water drips off of them should not be used for the top part of the filter as all the water that falls into the bottom should pass through the ceramic candles. If the top canary leaks too much the inside can be sealed with a cement and Sikalite mixture.</p>

<p>While it was simply not feasible for me to work closely with the water filter entrepreneur in hindsight I should have done a better job getting another volunteer to adopt this excellent project.</p>
