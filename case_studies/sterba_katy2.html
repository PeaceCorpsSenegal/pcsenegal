<h1>Latrine Project</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>PCVs Katy Sterba and Melissa Hunt facilitated a large-scale latrine project in both of their villages during the end of their first year of service that was completed in March 2011. Both volunteers realized the need in their villages for latrines as villagers were in the habit of using the bush to relieve themselves. PCVs were also seeing a huge problem with diarrhea in people of all ages and the volunteers hoped that villagers, with the use of a latrine, would take more control over their hygiene practices and attempt to reduce the incidences of diarrhea in both communities. A total of 53 latrines were constructed extending improved access to proper sanitation facilities to approximately 690 people.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p><a href="photos/sterba_katy_1_600.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/sterba_katy_1_200.jpg" class="floatright"></a>Keur Ndongo, PCV Katy Sterba’s site, is located within the communité rurale of Kouthia Ba where PCV Melissa Hunt is located and is about 7km away from Kouthia Ba via charette path. Keur Ndongo boasts a population of approximately 250 people while Kouthia Ba Wolof contains about 1600 residents. In both Keur Ndongo and Kouthia Ba there is a mixture of Wolofs, Pula Futas, and Pulaar Djery with varying ideas regarding proper sanitation. During their baselines surveys, both PCVs were informed as to the need for latrines by members of each vcommunity and when discussing potential issues with the ICP in Kouthia Ba he confirmed the prevalence of diarrhea and sanitation related issues in both areas. In Keur Ndongo there were total of seven latrines but most were unusable and caving in and there was a very low level of concern with regards to proper hygiene. Kouthia Ba, being a larger town with greater access to information proved to have more people using latrines, about 90 already existed in the town but most were in need of major repair,  thus prompting the desire to conduct a project to address these issues.</p>

<h3>The Approach</h3>

<p><a href="photos/sterba_katy_2_536.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/sterba_katy_2_200.jpg" class="floatright"></a>PCVs Sterba and Hunt discussed with their village counterparts and the ICP the prospect of assisting those interested families in carrying out a project in the two villages to help increase access to proper sanitation facilities coupling this with related causeries. A committee was formed in both towns and the selected members were charged with organizing and helping to facilitate the project. PCVS began the project in their first year of service opting to wait until after the first harvest so that villagers would have the money to cotizé. Villagers agreed that waiting until right after the rains in PCVs second year of service (Fall 2010) would make digging the latrine pits easier as the ground would still be a little bit wet and much more conducive to digging. PCVs collected the cotization from each family that wanted to participate after the harvest in 2010 and informed the participants that they should start digging after the rains ended in 2010, right around October/November. A total of 53 families cotized by the end of the cotization period, 16 in Lewe and 37 in Kouthia Ba. The participants agreed to dig the latrine pits, bring the sand, rocks, and water necessary to construct the latrines, and the cement, metal rods, and mason labor would be paid for through a Peace Corps Partnership grant.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>A total of 53 latrines were constructed in the two communities combined extending access to proper sanitation facilities to approximately 690 people. Accompanying health causeries were conducted in each village to inform families on the importance of using the latrine and ways by which they could improve their hygiene practices. In addition, participants were taught how to repair the latrine when  necessary and make a new latrine of equal quality when their latrine was full, or if it became unusable for any reason. Two sacks of cement were purchased for each latrine and whatever was not used during the initial construction was left to the family to use for repairs.</p>

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>

<p><a href="photos/sterba_katy_3_644.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/sterba_katy_3_200.jpg" class="floatright"></a>One of the biggest problems PCVs faced was getting people to actually dig the latrine pits. Those in Keur Ndongo claimed that there was only one man in the village that could dig the holes and PCV Hunt experienced the same phenomenon in Kouthia Ba.  A meeting was called in Keur Ndongo with the owner of every house participating in the project wherein they discussed other options for getting the holes dug. PCVs informed the initial participants that if they waited for one person to dig every pit time would run out and the latrines would not all be completed by the time PCVs contracts in Senegal were finished. The problem arose because when PCVs originally told families to start digging the families waited two months to actually start. After repeatedly telling families that they must dig and seeing nothing change, PCVs informed participants who were not digging that if holes were not dug by the end of November their latrine would be sold to another member of the village who was willing to get the job done. Eventually all latrine holes were dug and a few spots in the project were sold to other members of the community who were motivated to dig the pit and bring the supplies necessary for the mason to complete the job.</p>

<p>Another issue PCVs confronted was ensuring the community members took ownership over the project and were willing to partake in every aspect of the project. Initially, many members of the community were hesitant to do anything without the volunteer telling them repeatedly. They seemed unwilling to do any work if the PCVs were not there to stand over them and make sure the tasks were completed. This could partially have been caused by their worry that if something went wrong they did not want to be blamed for the error. However, PCVs reminded the participants along with the mason that this was a community project and even if mistakes were made, it was better to learn from these mistakes than to rely solely on the PCVs to make the project perfect.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p><a href="photos/sterba_katy_4_640.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/sterba_katy_4_200.jpg" class="floatright"></a>It is the hope of PCVs that other members of each community will see the changes the participating community members are making with regards to their hygiene and use of sanitation facilities. If using a latrine and washing your hands becomes more prevalent in these areas, more people will begin to adopt them and the instances of diarrhea and dysentery will decrease and the general cleanliness of the communities will improve. The committee members in each community are charged with making sure that people are using the latrines and trying to ensure that proper hand-washing is taking place.</p>
