<H1>Women’s Entrepreneurship Training</H1>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Listening to the needs of their communities, Peace Corps Volunteers in neighboring northern towns teamed up to organize a two day women’s conference and training to discuss women’s changing roles in the Fouta region, and to encourage and brainstorm income generating activities, led by mentor Awa Traore.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/wet_03_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/thumbs/wet_03_200.jpg" id="floatleft" border="0" /></a>In the swath of villages and towns that follow the meandering Senegal River along Senegal’s northern border with Mauritania, the conservative Pulaar ethnic group dominates.  It is standard practice for girls to leave school at an early age in order to help with the incredible work load in large extended families, or for an arranged marriage.  Young women who have the opportunity to continue to study often find that there are simply no jobs available to them.</p>  
<p>Given this information, it is no surprise that women have higher rates of illiteracy and minimal prospects for employment, leaving them vulnerable and dependant on their husbands for every need, ranging from food and clothing to medication for themselves and their children.  During their work with local women’s groups, Peace Corps Volunteers Michael Shannon (SED 2008-2010) and Renee Philbeck (EE 2009-2011) learned that the primary concern among women was financial dependence on their husbands and the lack of available work.</p>  
<p>Previous visits by Awa Traore, the Culture and Gender and Development Coordinator of Peace Corps, produced discussions about the variety of factors that lead to this vulnerability:  fear of being ostracized, desire to fit cultural norms defining wives and mothers, and low immediate payoff for continuing studies.  Building on these earlier conversations, the Women’s Entrepreneurship Training was organized.  Ten women were invited to learn and participate in the conference, which had as its goals to uncover and overcome hindrances to working by using creative problem solving, exploration of practical work projects including consumer standards, and introduction to basic accounting.</p>


<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/wet_01_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/thumbs/wet_01_200.jpg" id="floatright" border="0" /></a>The first day of the training brought together 10 women representing three local towns: Kanel, Ourossogui, and Matam.  Awa began simply by asking the participants about themselves:  How old were they?  When did they get married?  Did they finish school?  How many children did they have? What are their responsibilities in the home?  This approach took into consideration the rich traditional fabric of Pulaar culture.  The question of the day was not “How do women organize and begin working?” but instead “How do these Pulaar women, living in the Fouta, organize and begin working while receiving encouragement from their communities?”  This approach laid a solid philosophical foundation, showing participants that not only was it their desire to work, but also a completely natural progression, because the same skills they exhibit in running their homes can be used to begin a successful business.  Their homework for Day 2 was to organize a presentation on their income generating ideas.</p>  
<p>Day Two’s presentations were varied and reflected the diverse talents of the group.  Some ideas included: selling fruit juices, gardening, and cross stitching handbags and wallets.  Each of these ideas was critiqued and improved upon through discussion.  Michael concluded this session by a lesson in the importance of basic accounting using role playing games and question and answer formats in both French and Pulaar.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/wet_04_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/thumbs/wet_04_200.jpg" id="floatleft" border="0" /></a>Participants of the training returned to their respective towns to share this new information with other women.  The women’s group of Kanel is working towards organizing themselves into an official governmentally-recognized group so as to receive outside funding and startup capital for future projects.  Their goal is to create a women’s garden, the products of which will be sold at the local market.  Because of the conference, the women’s group of Kanel has reported a renewed enthusiasm and the ability to map their ideas step-by-step in order to reach what had previously seemed unattainable.  The participant from Matam has returned to her previous job as a cook for an NGO after using Awa's advice and strategies on how to politely but confidently confront her employer about issues she had been having at work. One of the participants from Ourossogui, a married student preparing for the BFM, is attending tutoring sessions led by Michael to get ready for the exam. According to her, a one-on-one talk with Awa at the end of the first day of the conference really clarified her priorities and gave her optimism and motivation to study hard for the exam and continue her studies.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>With Renee’s help, the women’s group of Kanel has created an action plan for organizing their garden.  They are working in conjunction with the cultural association of their neighborhood to find a plot of land for the project, and are researching funding options for a fence and water source.  The other participants from Ourossogui have asked Michael to do a training on Neem lotion and another on finding a business idea. Michael will use the experience he gained from preparing and teaching his accounting lesson to teach other women's groups in Ourossogui and Matam. He will continue to make himself available to the women's group in Ourossogui that attended the conference while identifying other groups or individuals who might be interested by the Neem lotion and “finding a business idea” trainings. He will continue to tutor students who are discouraged and risk abandoning their studies, giving them advice on decision-making and goal-setting in addition to helping them with their lessons.  Each volunteer is committed to providing the connection to resources and self-esteem counseling necessary to create a strong foundation, which will lead to future successes for these motivated women.</p>
