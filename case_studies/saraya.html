<H1>Kedougou Regional Mosquito Net Distribution

</H1>

<h3>Summary</h3><p>Beginning in July of 2007, Peace Corps Kedougou launched a partnership with the NGO NetLife to facilitate the distribution of Long-Lasting Insectide treated mosquito Nets (LLINs). In 2007, 2008, and 2009 Peace Corps and NetLife distributed 1,100 – 5,000 – and 13,500- LLINs respectively, in each case providing universal coverage in the target area. In addition to the physical distribution, Peace Corps held trainings in over 100 villages on the importance of correctly hanging, maintaining and using LLINs. The trainings also reinforced the role of local Health Extension Agents, informing local residents of the rapid testing and treatment services available through the HEA system.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p><img src="photos/thumbs/Saraya1_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" />
NetLife is a US-based NGO started by Jesse Mathews and former Peace Corps Volunteer Andrew Sherman. Having done a small LLIN distribution in 2005 in the Kedougou area, NetLife approached Peace Corps Kedougou in the spring of 2007 to propose working collaboratively on future distributions. This was seen as an amazing oportunity as Peace Corps Kedougou had independently identified Malaria control as a priority work area and unversal LLIN coverage and associated education as the preferred intervention.</p>
<p>Initially a partnership between NetLife, Peace Corps, and the Senegalese government health infrastructure, the effort has expanded into a coalition of partners including: TOSTAN, La Lumiere, World Vision, Against Malaria, USAID, Malaria No More, and others. Some partners provide transportation logistics support, while others (notably Against Malaria and MNM) provide financial support, and still others provide field agents to help with distributions and training events.</p>
<p>Universal coverage as a distribution methodology is gaining ground in the public discussion on malaria prevention. The Senegalese government malaria control agency, Plan National pour Lutte contre le Paludisme (PNLP) has expressed interest in extending the universal coverage concept to other areas of Senegal, and international donors are increasingly prioritizing funds to projects which provide universal coverage of a geographically contiguous area. Peace Corps Kedougou is uniquely positioned to facilitate partnerships between local and internation NGOs, governmental agencies, international bi-lateral and multi-lateral aid agencies and, most importantly, local people.</p>
<p>Volunteers have worked as catalysts and coordinators, linking NetLife and their funding partner AgainstMalaria to the Senegalese government health infrastructure and HEAs. Peace Corps volunteers have also been instrumental in bringing together the various partners, coordinating the transportation logistics and physically distributing the nets and holding trainings.</p>

<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p><img src="photos/thumbs/Saraya2_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright"/><b>Ordering and fundraising</b> – Volunteers work with NetLife to determine the amount of fundraising (and thus number of LLINs) that is practicable in a given year. From that basis, volunteers work with local government to identify a geographically contiguous area to be provided universal coverage with those LLINs. This involves training local HEAs in census taking and working closely with the Districts Sanitaires and Postes de Santes.</p>
<p><b>Partnership building</b> – to effectively distribute the nets requires a significant amount of transportation logistics. Volunteers work with local and international NGOs and private sector actors to build the partnership of transportation resources necessary to distribute the LLINS.</p>
<p><b>Distribution</b> – When the LLINs arrive at the site, volunteers work with the transportation partners to devliver them directly to villages. To avoid resale of LLINs on the black market, they are all removed from their packaging and the name of the village and date is written directly on the LLIN in magic marker.</p>
<p><b>Training</b> – concurrently with distribution, volunteers and partner agents provide trainings at every distribution point. Trainings emphasize the malarial parasite life-cycle, steps you can take to avoid contracting malaria, and how to recognize and treat malaria. Reinforcement of the government health infrastructure is an important part of the training process since most villagers are unaware of the services available to them.</p>
<p><b>Monitoring and Evaluation</b> – Post distribution, volunteers work with the Postes de Sante to monitor year over year changes in malaria morbidity and mortality. Randomized spot checks are performed in villages to confirm proper LLIN usage.</p>
<p>As the project brings together an eclectic group of partners from many sectors, good relationships with the local development community is a prerequisite. Also internal communication channels within Peace Corps greatly facilitate this project. Dakar based volunteers and staff were vital in coordinating shipping logistics of the LLINs to Dakar, and from Dakar to Kedougou. Lastly, while Peace Corps volunteers were not (nor should they be) significantly involved in the fundraising aspect of the project, strong relationships with funding partners were vital. And providing those partners with visual images and data to support their fundraising efforts was necessary.</p>
<p>Volunteer’s roles in the project have changed over time. Initially volunteers handled all aspects of distribution in collaboration with NetLife, from running trainings, to taking census, to shipping logistics and the physical distribution of the LLINs. As the partnership has grown, many tasks have been assumed by other players, i.e. TOSTAN and La Lumiere provided trainers to the most recent distribution. Peace Corps Kedougou has a long term skills transfer plan that will gradually decrease the role of volunteers as partners are trained up in skills such as shipping logistics management, fundraising, and monitoring and evaluation.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>The project was able to provide, to date, roughly 20,000 LLINs, providing universal coverage in over 100 communities. The distribution cost per net – from the manufacturer to the communities – was less than a dollar per net. The most important result of the project so far has been the partnership building and links created between the various organizations working in Malaria prevention in the region.</p>



<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p><img src="photos/thumbs/Saraya3_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" />Over time, this project is expected to significantly decrease the malaria related mortality in the region. While the current structure of the project corresponds to a “catch-up” strategy, next year’s distribution should complete the regional coverage at which time the project will transition into “keep-up” mode with smaller yearly distributions to replace LLINs that are damaged and cover new in-migration.</p>
<p>There are many challeges to the continuity of the project:</p>
<p><b>Decentralization</b> –currently the project is being managed by a core group of NetLife agents and Peace Corps volunteers. Though skills transfer is happening, this needs to accelerate, specifically managerial skills and shipping logistics. Without spreading these skills the project is vulnerable to the loss of a key individual or individuals.<p>
<p><b>Funding diversification</b> – the main funding source is currently NetLife donors with support in finding matching donations from Against Malaria. NetLife needs to aggressively diversify its funding sources. Options include – local fundraising events, the Senegalese diaspora community in Europe and the US, larger international donors such as the Gates Foundation, USAID, and MalariaNoMore. Additionally, a funding partnership should be begun with the Senegalese government, with the long term goal of transfering all financial responsibility to the government as the country’s financial status allows.</p>
<p><b>Cross Border Issues</b> – Malaria vectors are not limited by national borders, thus the effectiveness of any malaria control measures in a border region will be affected by measures used (or not used) in neighboring countries. Also, a consistent, substantial supply of LLINs in a region adjacent to both Mali and Guinea, and connected to those countries by kinship ties, may lead to cross border smuggling of LLINs. To combat this, NetLife is planning to pilot a distribution in both Mali and Guinea next year. Partnerships with Malian and Guinean development organizations should be rapidly scaled up.</p>
<p><b>Continued usage</b> – As Malaria rates fall, complacency and decreased LLIN usage may occur. As NetLife moves into the “keep-up” phase, resources should be diverted to increased trainings with a message specifically targeting the benefits of consistent LLIN usage.</p>
<p><b>Project Competition</b> – as universal LLIN coverage becomes the norm for malaria control interventions, the project may see other actors interested in providing coverage in the Kedougou zone. The project should avoid duplication of services as much as possible by reaching out to new potential partners, working closely with the government agencies, and being receptive to outside ideas. If a larger organization with the resources to provide universal coverage in the Kedougou zone as part of a larger program arrives, the project should be prepared to abandon its distribution role and turn to training and advocacy of their distribution model while searching for a new niche in malaria control.</p>
<p>The long term outlook for the sustainability of this project is very good provided Peace Corps and Netlife commit to a well planned and gradual skills transfer and address the issues raised above.</p>
