<H1>Mangrove Reforestation in Sokone</H1>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/mangrove_06_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/mangrove_06_200.jpg" id="floatright" border="0" /></a>Fifteen Peace Corps Volunteers and the Sine-Saloum Delta host community of Sokone, reforested over 7,500 mangrove trees of the Rhizaphora species.  Such a practice is scalable, replicable and sustainable in other communities where mangrove species can be found.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>There are two species of Mangrove trees that were once found in abundance in the delta region, and along river banks in Senegal: Rhizaphora and Avencennia.  While both species can still be found, their numbers have been decreasing at a fast rate and dramatic differences have been noted especially during the past 50 years.   PCV Laura Coberly (2008-2010), an Urban Agriculture extension agent, worked with the <i>Eaux et Forets</i> (Water and Forests agency) and the Mayorâ€™s office, to educate members of over 27 Sokone community groups in the importance of mangrove retention, and to work toward the reversal of damages that have already been done.</p>  
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/mangrove_05_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/mangrove_05_200.jpg" id="floatleft" border="0" /></a>The main threats to mangroves are human beings.  The trees are often cut down for their wood -- mangrove wood is desirable in the creation of huts because termites do not attack it -- and the trees are also often cut down during the harvesting of oysters, which fixate themselves to the tree roots.</p>  
<p>Upon initial questioning, many members of the Sokone community were reluctant to work toward the reforestation of the mangroves because such an act is said to not bring the individuals any direct financial benefit.  However, the loss of mangroves indirectly affects the community at large.  Without the mangroves, a tree which grows in and acts as a filter of salt water, the salinity of the water increases and harms nearby vegetation.  The increased salt in the water may also seep into fresh water wells that are used for potable water.   The distinctive root structure of the mangrove trees also acts as a unique ecosystem for fish, birds and other species such as oysters and crab.  If the mangroves are cut down, then this ecosystem, an ecosystem that the community as a whole is dependent upon for food, is destroyed.</p>

<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/mangrove_01_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/mangrove_01_200.jpg" id="floatright" border="0" /></a>The mangrove reforestation project that was implemented consisted of three main tasks completed over a period of three days.</p> 
<p>Day one consisted of PCV Laura Coberly, along with two other Peace Corps Volunteers, and three Senegalese Nationals, taking a boat into the delta to harvest mangrove seedlings.  While mangrove seedlings can be procured without the aid of a boat, the time period that was chosen for project execution required such usage.</p>
<p>Day two consisted of a thorough training of community members in the importance of the mangroves, and the techniques that should be used for efficient reforestation.  The training was conducted in the local language by a knowledgeable agent of the <i>Eaux et Forets</i> of Sokone.</p>  
<p>Day three consisted of the actual reforestation, using techniques that were discussed during the training.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/mangrove_03_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/mangrove_03_200.jpg" id="floatleft" border="0" /></a>Over the period of three days, over 110 Senegalese Nationals were either educated in, or directly involved in mangrove reforestation; and over 7,500 seedlings were planted.</p> 
<p>Mangroves are slow growing, and the results of the reforestation will not be apparent for several years.  However, given the low- to no-cost nature of the project, such an endeavor is worthwhile.  The costs involved in this project consisted of a boat rental for seedling collection (a cost that is necessary only at the early stages of seedling development, and only if high quantities of seedlings are needed at that time); chair rentals for the training, and juice and snacks after the reforestation was completed.  Ideally, such a project could be implemented without any financial burden.</p>


<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>Though a comprehensive training which covered the importance of mangroves and their ecosystems for the local community was given, an adequate alternative to cutting down the mangroves for wood and for oyster harvesting remains desirable.</p>  
<p>The training of the community and the act of reforestation was a starting point for the participating groups, who will now be able to share their newfound knowledge and reforest on their own accord.  This project is a low cost, sustainable and straightforward way in which the Senegalese people can beautify their community and influence food security by protecting and encouraging unique habitats for fish, birds, and other wildlife.</p>
