<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>PCV Paul Levy, with help from PCVs Madeline Tiee and Joshua Birmingham, participated in a project to repair and expand the Guia Ecole Primaire’s bathroom facilities in an effort to provide functional latrines and better sanitation to 400 students and 14 teachers, as well as reduce the incidence of Schistosomiasis in the general population. </p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/paul_05_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/paul_05_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a>
Schistosomiasis, a potentially lethal parasitic disease, is prevalent in Northern Senegal, particularly near the Senegal River.  Infection from Schistosomiasis occurs when a person comes in contact with fresh water harboring certain types of snails hosting the parasite.  After infection, the disease makes its way into the host’s liver, intestines, or bladder.  In certain cases the parasite continues to the brain or spinal cord, causing seizures or paralysis.  After the host becomes infected, he or she can pass the disease back into a water source through his or her urine or feces.  Therefore the existence of properly maintained bathroom and sanitation facilities, coupled with persistent and effective education addressing how Schistosomiasis is spread, is crucial to stopping the disease’s lifecycle.</p>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/paul_06_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/paul_06_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" /></a>The small town of Guia is located roughly six kilometers from Podor and is situated on a tributary of the Senegal River.  A farming community, Guia is replete with canals and crop irrigation, making Schistosomiasis particularly prevalent in the region.  The town’s primary school is precariously situated between a canal—in which people often bathe, draw water, and wash laundry—and a tributary of the Senegal River.  Adding to the problem, the school of 400 children has only one working latrine, sending children to either the river or canal to use the bathroom.  In 2008, 144 students out of the 151 tested—about 95.36%--were found to harbor some form of the parasite.  After the initial testing NGOs and the Senegalese government donated medicine to the school.  Six weeks later, after two rounds of medicine, it was found that 52.41% of students tested were infected—an improved but nevertheless unacceptably high statistic.  Given the ease with which the disease is acquired (and re-acquired), together with the cyclical nature of Schistosomiasis, a more permanent and sustainable change needs to take place to keep the disease from reestablishing its hold on the school’s population.</p>


<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/paul_04_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/paul_04_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a></a>After being approached in Podor by the director of Guia’s Ecole Primaire, several visits were made to the school and the surrounding area to accurately assess the needs of the community and the severity of the situation.  PCVs immediately found the restroom facilities in need of renovation: three of the four latrines were clogged to the point that they could no longer be used, a result of faulty plumbing and ineffective waste-storage facilities.  Furthermore, the doors to the latrines were damaged and could not close.  It rapidly became clear that both the school staff and community members viewed the disrepair of the bathroom and sanitation facilities at the school as a pressing problem.</p>
<p>Working with the school director, a local mason, and the President of the Schools of Guia, PCVs Paul Levy, Madeline Tiee, and Joshua Birmingham discussed what work needed to be done to both ensure that the latrines would be fixed and that they would remain usable long into the future.  In an effort to increase the project’s long-term impact, it was agreed upon by all parties that if work were to proceed, a series of educational sessions would need to be held in the school and its environs emphasizing the importance of using and maintaining the latrines in stopping the propagation of Schistosomiasis.  Finally, PCVs and community members agreed that a hand-washing/ sanitation station could be built next to the repaired bathrooms, allowing for the school’s sanitary needs to be met.  After agreeing on the details and cost of the project, and after obtaining a grant from Appropriate Projects: Water Charity, work began on the latrines.</p>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/paul_02_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/paul_02_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" /></a>Upon receipt of the funds, PCVs Paul Levy and Madeline Tiee went with a local mason and the school director to buy materials for the project.  After the necessary materials had been bought and the sand and gravel had arrived by truck, the mason began making bricks for the hand-washing/shower station while Paul Levy went to a nearby town to oversee door repairs with the school director. Meanwhile the mason began draining the latrines’ waste-storage tank.  After the sewage tank had been drained and expanded, the top was rebuilt to ensure that nothing could permeate it, and new piping was installed.  Finally, once the addition was complete, the newly-repaired doors and the door to the addition were installed.  As a gesture to the community, PCVs Madeline Tiee and Paul Levy painted the doors and the shutters of the building.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/paul_01_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/paul_01_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft"/></a>As a result of the project all 400 students and 14 teachers now have access to four fully functional latrines and a new hand-washing and shower station.  Sanitation at the school has therefore been improved from two angles—students are no longer using the school grounds and river to go to the bathroom, and they now have a close and efficient place to wash their hands after using the restroom.</p><br /><br /><br />

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/paul_03_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/paul_03_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" /></a>To ensure that the facilities are being used—and as a general follow up—plans have been made to begin a series of causeries at the primary school in Guia and in the surrounding town, where PCVs will hold educational sessions regarding the importance of using the new latrines as a means of preventing the spread of Schistosomiasis.</p>
<p>Upon the completion of these projects in Guia, PCVs in the Podor area plan to continue working to prevent Schistosomiasis through sanitation projects and educational sessions.  Due to the persistent and cyclical nature of Schistosomiasis, coupled with local populations’ dependence on the river in almost all aspects of daily life, it is important to enlist a broad and nuanced plan of attack when working to prevent the propagation of the disease.  Future projects in the department of Podor aim to continue utilizing this crucial balance between aid and education.  To do otherwise would be addressing only part of the problem, leaving behind an environment where Schistosomiasis can easily recur.</p>
