<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><img src="photos/thumbs/IMG_0380.JPG" id="floatright" width="150px" />In February 2011, PCV Camille Hogan, from the department of Velingara, extended an invitation to 12 women and their babies in her community, Courbambey, to participate in a 12 day HEARTH model.  The program consisted of initial meetings to introduce the program to parents of moderately malnourished babies in the “yellow zone” on the growth chart and ask for volunteers.  3 participants were chosen by their peers as “positive deviant” mothers or “mamans lumières” and acted as the leaders of the group.  After a few instructive meetings, they launched the 12 day program.   Each day the 12 participating mothers made an enhanced porridge and discussed a different health lesson.  The babies were weighed at the start and finish of the program to track their progress and follow-up weigh-ins will be done twice in the next two months.  The program’s goal was to take moderately malnourished children of similar age and weight and consistently feed them an enhanced porridge over the course of 12 days.  By the end of the program mother’s had a better understanding of nutrition and general health and became better habituated in making enhanced porridge from locally available foods.  Additionally, the participating babies showed signs of improvement and should show  signs of moderate to significant improvement over the course of the next 2 months if all new techniques and practices learned are applied.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>From January-September 2010, the PCV had done a “Healthy Baby Program” through Courbambey’s health hut.  132 women and their babies participated in monthly weigh-ins for the babies and health lessons.  The purpose of the “Healthy Baby Program” was to encourage villagers and health workers to use the health hut facilities on a more regular basis and properly weigh and monitor babies’ growth weights in addition to learning new mechanisms on managing children’s overall health/nutrition. As a follow-up program, the PCV implemented the HEARTH model to do more in-depth focus on infant nutrition and hands-on enhanced porridge making.  The HEARTH model applies the lessons learned from the “Healthy Baby Contest” and shows what actions are needed to take place in regards to malnourished children.</p>

<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p><img src="photos/thumbs/IMG_0204.JPG" id="floatleft" height="150px" />The program began with the PCV reviewing statistics from the “Healthy Baby Program” and selecting 17 potential candidates consisting of moderately malnourished babies of the same age and weight “ to participate in the HEARTH model.  Meetings were held with the 17 mothers and their husbands to explain the program and ask for volunteers who would like to participate in the program.  12 women and their babies were selected to participate and 2 more informational meetings were held to explain the program’s expectations and significance.  The participants chose the meeting time, location, and ingredients used for the porridge.  An attendance chart was also created and the women collectively decided that those who came late would be responsible for cleaning up that day.  Additionally, each woman was asked to bring cooking materials, ingredients, and small amounts of money to pay for medications and supplies.  3 women were selected by their peers to be the “Mamans Lumières” or “Positive Deviant Mothers” meaning that they would be the leaders of the group, organizing/motivating everyone and presenting the different health lessons each day.  The “Mamans Lumières” were given 3 days of additional training before the program was launched.  One week before the launch of the program each participating baby was given de-worming medicine and Vitamin A.  The babies’ BMI’s (body mass index’s) were first evaluated by measuring their heights, weights, and arm circumferences.  The HEARTH model consisted on 13 consecutive days (with one break day) of enhanced porridge making and different health lessons.  The same porridge was made each day consisting of the following recipe:
<ul>
	<li>1.5 kg of millet powder</li>
    <li>0.5 kg of bean powder </li>
    <li>0.5 kg of peanut powder</li>
    <li>0.5 kg of sugar</li>
    <li>1 tsp of iodized salt</li>
    <li>A handful of tamarind</li>
    <li>A handful of moringa powder</li>
</ul></p>

<p><img src="photos/thumbs/IMG_0286.JPG" id="floatright" width="150px" />The following health lessons were presented along with 2 review days:
<ul>
	<li>The Importance of Hand washing/Demonstrating Germs by using a Potato</li>
    <li>Diarrhea/Oral Rehydration Salt</li>
    <li>Prenatal health/Pregnancy Danger Signs</li>
    <li>Breastfeeding/Weaning</li>
    <li>Vaccinations</li>
    <li>Malnutrition verses Nutrition</li>
    <li>Healthy Food Pyramid</li>
    <li>The Importance/Benefits of Moringa </li>
    <li>Malaria Education/Neem Lotion Making</li>
    <li>Proper Wound Care</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Each day, the program started with women and babies washing their hands with soap, treating/filtering the well water, and washing the dishes/cooking supplies properly.  2 new women were selected each day to cook the porridge.  The “Mamans Lumieres” presented the health lessons using visual aids in an animated fashion.  When the porridge was ready and cooled down the mothers would feed the babies and take the remainders home to save for later.  The porridge is designed to be enough caloric intake for the infants entire day and is meant to be eaten slowly over the course of 24 hours.  After the 12 days were completed the babies BMI was again measured to see if any signs of improvement were made.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>The participating mothers became more aware of steps they can take to prevent malnutrition and ways to treat it.  They are also more habituated in making an enhanced porridge from locally available foods.  The participating mothers also have a better understanding of healthy habits to practice at home.  Additionally, the participating babies showed signs of growth and improvement after the 12 day program.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p><img src="photos/thumbs/IMG_0271.JPG" id="floatright" width="150px" />The babies’ Body Mass Indexes will be measured again in a one month follow-up and a two-month follow-up procedure.  Most studies state that signs of significant improvement are shown during these two months.  This program can also be replicated to other target groups in the community and surrounding areas.</p>

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>It was difficult at first to ensure that the women would come on time everyday.  The participating mothers decided collaboratively to create a late policy.  If a woman showed up more than five minutes late, she became responsible for cleaning up that day.  This was also reinforced by having a public attendance chart on display each day.  Additionally, it was difficult to know if the participating babies were eating all of the enhanced porridges themselves or if the food was given out at home. Participants started feeding the babies together after the porridge was prepared to ensure that they were at least receiving some of the porridge.  However, the porridge is meant to last all day, not just for one meal, so it was difficult to guarantee that no one else ate the meal.</p>
