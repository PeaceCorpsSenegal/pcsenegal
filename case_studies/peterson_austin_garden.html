Summary
Between May 20th and August 7th 2010 a series of classes on organic gardening practices were held in Tambacounda.  A group of ten local gardeners was trained in composting, vegetable nurseries, micro/container gardening, beneficial landscaping and tree integration, garden bed preparation and organic soil amendments, garden planning, crop rotation, companion planting, organic pesticides, seed saving, and yield recording.

Context
The city of Tambacounda, Senegal is home to roughly 100,000 people living in urban and peri-urban conditions. While the city has a large population, the density is not great and many people tend small-scale gardens producing vegetables for personal consumption and market sale. The region of Tambacounda is traditionally pastoral and many people, while interested in gardening, lack the technical skills necessary to practice sustainable agriculture while simultaneously bringing crop yields to economically viable levels. 

The Approach
	This series of gardening classes was designed to educate local home and market gardeners in organic practices, strengthen the sense of community among the city’s gardeners, and locate gardeners who might be capable of becoming community teachers themselves. To this end, a group of ten local gardeners was chosen from among those gardeners seeking agricultural information from the local department of agriculture.  For each class, the group gathered in the morning at the Peace Corps demonstration garden located at the department of Agriculture for a discussion of the days topic as well as a visual demonstration of the established technique. Following the discussion all participants then recollected at one or another of the participants gardens for hands on technical training.

Results
May 20th -  Compost:  The demonstration was held in the garden of Mamadou Leye a local market gardener. 9 of the 10 participants were present. 7 of those 9 have implemented compost systems in their gardens.
June 1st – Pepinaire and Micro Gardening: A class on nursery techniques and micro gardening was held in the garden of Awa Sal. Participants were trained in the following techniques: portable vegetable nurseries, soil mixtures, protection methods, hanging containers, and substratum mixtures. Since the date of the demonstration, 8 of the 9 participants have implemented some or all of the nursery techniques and 3 of the 9 have begun to garden in containers where appropriate.
June 8th – Garden Design: This class was held in the garden of Ibrahim Diallo. His garden is located on the bank of the Mamakounda River and is subject to annual floods and soil erosion due to the large amount of runoff coming from upslope. As part of the class, we discussed ways to identify where water traveled on the landscape and then installed a series berms, diversion swales, and shallow ponds to mitigate flooding and soil erosion. Fast growing, nitrogen-fixing trees were then planted where appropriate to help stabilize the landscaping that had been installed. The demonstration was an initial success, however the landscaping, which requires a high degree of initial maintenance until the trees have established root systems, was not maintained by the gardener and much of the work disappeared after subsequent rain storms. However, 6 of the 9 participants present began to integrate nitrogen-fixing and soil building trees into their gardens after the class.
June 15th – Garden Bed Preparation: This class was held in the garden of Awa Sall. Improved bed techniques including  deep bed preparation and organic soil amendments such as compost, charcoal powder, and wood ash were taught. Since this class 4 of the 8 present participants have begun double digging their garden beds before planting, and 7 of the 8 have begun to use soil amendments on their garden beds.
June 29th – Crop Rotation, Companion Planting, and Integrated Pest Management:  This class was held in the garden of Pate Amar where we discussed the cultural aspects of Integrated Pest Management. The class content included space saving and pest preventative companion planting, the importance of crop rotation for nutrient enrichment and pest control, and how to make bio-pesticides out of locally available materials. Since the date of the class 9 of the 9 present participants have implemented varying degrees of beneficial intercropping. 1 of the 9 has begun using bio-pesticides and 4 of the 9 have created and begun to implement crop rotation programs.
August 7th – Seed Saving and Over-view: The final session was held in the garden of Pape Laye. In this class we discussed the necessity of developing regionally appropriate cultivars, and ways to reliably save seed from all of the vegetables grown for local market gardens. Since the date of the class 8 of the 8 present participants have begun to save seed from a variety of different vegetables including, okra, eggplant, tomato, pepper, cucumber, bitter tomato, and lettuce.

Lessons learned
The purpose of holding each class in a different garden was intended to foster a sense of community among local market gardeners. While this goal was a success, the continual change of venue made establishing technical continuity difficult. The next series of gardening classes will be co-taught by Awa Sall, a former garden class participant, and held in her garden. By doing this, the new class will profit from her gardening knowledge, and she will gain from the labor directed toward the hands-on aspect of the technical trainings. The ultimate goal is to establish Awa as a local gardening resource who will be able to conduct trainings on her own with members of the gardening community.
