<H1>Linguère Basketball Project</H1>

<h3>Summary</h3><p>Peace Corps Volunteers in and around Linguère have worked with middle and high schools in the area to promote basketball and youth development in the region. Volunteers and community members have collaborated to renovate the high school basketball court in Linguère and to facilitate several coed clinics. These activities have begun to develop the skill level of participants, have greatly increased the interest in the sport throughout the department and have promoted youth leadership and teamwork. PCVs hope to expand these basketball-related projects in order to promote the growth of the game in the department of Linguère.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p><a href="photos/basketball_03_700.jpg"><img src="photos/thumbs/basketball_03_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a>
This collaborative project began in 2008. High school gym teachers and PCVs in Linguère recognized a need to improve the existing basketball facilities in order to allow the sport to develop in Linguère. Basketball is unique in Linguère in that during both pickup and formal games, boys and girls play together. Peace Corps Volunteers recognized that improving the basketball facilities and following up with co-ed clinics and tournaments would both improve the physical education program and encourage this practice of gender inclusivity.  </p>
<p>This project also has a broader goal of promoting basketball and gender development throughout the region by inviting students from neighboring villages where no basketball facilities currently exist to participate in clinics and tournaments in Linguère. Additionally, volunteers and the teachers they work with hope to spread awareness of basketball and increase the sport’s visibility in order promote youth development by teaching and encouraging physical fitness and wellness, strength and coordination, teamwork, self-confidence, sportsmanship, leadership and responsibility. Finally, PCVs feel that opportunities are traditionally very limited for students in this area who are not skilled at, or have little interest in soccer, the dominant sport in the area.</p>

<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p><a href="photos/basketball_05_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/basketball_05_225.jpg" border="0" id="floatright"/></a>The first phase of this project, which took place in 2008 and 2009, involved renovating the existing basketball court at Lycée Alboury Ndiaye in Linguère. PCVs, the high school director and high school gym teachers collaborated to submit a Peace Corps Partnership proposal to fund the expansion and refurbishment. With the support of the SEEDS Project, the court was expanded and new hoops were installed to create two regulation-sized courts.</p>
<p>During the second phase, which began in 2009, PCVs collaborated with gym teachers from Linguère and two neighboring villages, Barkédji and Ouarkhokh to organize monthly coed basketball clinics for middle school students throughout the school year. Each morning clinic focuses on building fundamental technical skills and introducing students to the rules of the game. Equal numbers of girls and boys participate in these clinics and male and female students play together.</p>
<p>The improved basketball facilities have also enabled further collaboration between the Linguère department and the SEEDS Project. In addition to providing educational materials, basketball hoops and other equipment, the SEEDS Project sent a team of coaches and trainers from the Thiès SEEDS Academy and the United States to Linguère in January, 2010 to lead a half-day clinic for male and female students.</p>



<h3>Results</h3>
<p><a href="photos/basketball_04_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/basketball_04_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft"/></a>Forty-two middle school students (twenty-one females and twenty-one males) have participated in the first two PCV and gym teacher-led clinics held in Linguère as of January, 2010. Three more half-day clinics and a tournament are scheduled for the 2009-2010 school year. On January 15, 2010, thirty middle- and high-school students from Linguère also participated in the coed SEEDS clinic.</p>
<p>In addition, the gym teachers now regularly use the courts to include basketball in the physical education curriculum. Finally, as a result of the improved basketball facilities and increased availability of balls, the number of students and adults participating in pickup games has increased.</p>
<p>Observation has indicated that these efforts have improved the skill level of players and have increased awareness of and interest in the game throughout the department.</p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>The renovation of the basketball court posed several technical challenges. Because the sport of basketball is relatively unknown in Senegal, masons generally don’t have technical knowledge of the best methods for constructing long-lasting courts and welders are inexperienced in hoop construction. Thus, PCVs are concerned that the poor construction will cause the court to rapidly deteriorate and require continued repairs over years to come. However, Linguère-area PCVs hope that other volunteers can use this experience to learn how to build longer-lasting courts in the future. Additionally, this challenge can highlight for other volunteers the importance of finding skilled, experienced masons or training local masons in best practices in court construction.</p>
<p>In addition, in organizing the clinics with students from Linguère and surrounding villages, volunteers have experienced difficulty finding reliable transportation to take students to and from clinics. As a result, PCVs hope to build courts in surrounding areas, in order to make basketball available to a wider population and to reduce the need to transport students to Linguère for clinics and tournaments.</p>


<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>Volunteers and community counterparts will continue facilitating monthly clinics throughout the school year. Once participants reach an adequate skill level, we will begin holding tournaments as well. In villages with sufficient interest, some volunteers hope to work with their communities to construct courts and hold clinics there, as well.</p>
