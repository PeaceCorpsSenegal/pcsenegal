<h3>Summary</h3><p>PCV Camille Hogan, from the department of Velingara, extended an
invitation to 3 villages in her area to participate in a Healthy Baby Program for the
duration of 8 months. The program consisted of weighing babies ages 0-2 years old
monthly coinciding with informational sessions geared towards infant nutrition/health.
The program’s goal was to encourage mothers to monitor their child’s growth, promote
the use of proper documentation amongst local health workers, and introduce new
techniques in infant nutrition/health. In total 135 babies were registered in the program
(132 mothers). At the end of the program the participating mothers along with their
babies and husbands were invited to celebrate their achievements and attend a health
fair. The top 6 performing women in the program were selected to each present one
of the informational sessions at the health fair with assistance of 17 PCVs and 4 local
health workers in over 6 local languages. Lunch proceeded the health fair along with
the certificate/gift ceremony for all participants. Over 400 community members and
participants were in attendance.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/camille_01_max.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/thumbs/camille_01_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" /></a>
The PCV’s village, Courbambey, is host to a local health hut that serves 13 of
the surrounding villages. The health hut’s ASC, 2 relais, and matron have been trained
to weigh babies monthly in addition to giving informational sessions on health related
issues in the community. The community and PCV acknowledged that a baby weighing
program and nutritional health lessons were in demand in the area, so the PCV replicated
a similar program from an RPCV in Cote d’Ivoire. The 3 villages of Courbambey,
Sare Waly, and Simbaye were invited to participate in the program. These villages
have a diverse range of languages spoken and cultures, mostly consisting of Bambara,
Mandinka, and Pula Fuuta.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Healthy Baby Program was to encourage villagers and health workers
to use the health hut facilities on a more regular basis and properly weigh and monitor
babies’ growth weights in addition to learning new mechanisms on managing children’s
overall health/nutrition.</p>


<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/camille_03_max.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/thumbs/camille_03_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft"/></a>The program began with the PCV consulting the “health team” consisting
of the ASC, 2 relais, and matron and designing an outline for the program. Meetings
were then held in each of the 3 participating villages to inform women, men, and village
leaders that the program would take place and invite them to participate. Following
the meetings, the PCV approached a local NGO, World Vision, for financial assistance
with the program in addition to writing a Peace Corps Partnership Program. Each
month babies were weighed and at the same time short health lessons were repeated
so participating women could come and go, since many women are pressed for time.
The first month was a practice run and each month thereafter had lessons consisting of
the following subject matter: vaccinations, nutritious foods/enhanced porridge making,
breastfeeding/weaning, home remedies, prenatal health care, and diarrhea/ORS. Each
month the babies’ ages, weights, and progress were documented and charted.</p>

<p>At the end of the program a health fair/celebration ceremony took place in Courbambey.
The 132 mothers were invited to attend in addition to their babies and husbands, and
community leaders. Over 400 people were in attendance. 17 PCVs were present and the
top 6 performing women were selected to repeat the lessons in local languages. Each
presenting woman was paired with PCVs and designated one subject matter. The day
before the event the presenters worked with the “health team” to review the lessons and
rehearse their presentations. To make the health fair more “hands on” the vaccinations
lesson was switched for a neem lotion making session so participants could see more
and become more involved. The health fair occurred under a large tree in the village
that provided shade and desks from the school were brought out to set up “booths” in a
circle around the tree. Each presenter had her own “booth” and a few PCVs to help assist
her. Though the women were responsible for giving the presentations, the PCVs were
there for support and assistance in addition to local health workers. After the health fair,
certificates were presented in addition to small “cadeaux,” speeches, music, and dancing.
Lunch was had and a soccer game was held after the celebration.</p>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/camille_02_max.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/thumbs/camille_02_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft"/></a>Throughout the program a few challenges did arise. For example, sticking to the
schedule proved to be very difficult. The “health team” would often agree upon a
date for weighing the babies and then things would come up at the last minute. It was
important to stay flexible and be aware of major holidays/seasons. Ideally the best time
to do the program would be from December through June. Additionally, after a first few
trial runs, it was agreed upon to do short causeries and repeat them because women are
often in a hurry to return home. If everything was done quickly and on the same day,
it was much more adhering to the women’s schedules. The most challenging aspect of
the program was that not every participant took the lessons seriously. Though it takes
more than doing a short lesson once to see true change in a village, it was disheartening
to see babies fall ill and mothers not apply the lessons learned. However, the goal of the
program is to introduce the mothers to healthy habits of weighing and monitoring the
child’s growth, not to see drastic changes of improvement on a short term level. After
introducing them to a steady routine, the program could expand to something more in-
depth.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Local health workers became better equipped and more efficient with the baby
weighing procedure and proper documentation, in addition to properly relaying the
babies’ progress to the mothers. Participating mothers learned new ways to improve
their child’s health and are in a more consistent routine of monitoring the child’s growth.
Men who attended the health fair gained a better understanding of the type of work the
mothers were doing and insight into the lessons learned. They also are more likely to
support the mothers in taking the children to be weighed and introducing new healthy
habits in the home.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/camille_04_max.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/thumbs/camille_04_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" /></a>After charting babies growth rates and learning the communities needs and
concerns the program could be followed-up by something involving smaller groups. The
babies can be grouped together with other babies of the same age and size and small
focus-groups can be formed to perform the HEARTH model, Care Group model, or
something of similar nature.</p>
