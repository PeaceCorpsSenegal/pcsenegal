<H1>Transformation of Fruits and Vegetables: Women's Juice Business in Kaffrine</H1>

<h3>Summary<a class="gallery" href="photos/juice_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/juice_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" /></a></h3><p>A group of young women in the city of Kaffrine developed a profitable business making and selling juice, juice concentrates, and jams from local produce. With the help of Peace Corps Volunteers, Ndoucomane Production has received legal authorization from the Senegalese government to sell its products and to work themselves as trainers. Currently the group sells in Kaffrine and a store in Koalack.  This project has allowed the participating women to develop technical skills in fruit and vegetable transformation as well as business managing and problem solving skills.  </p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p> In 2006 the PCV living in Kaffrine helped connect the women of Ndoucomane Productions with the Institut de Technologie Alimentaire, which provided initial training and certification as a groupement d’intérêt économique (G.I.E.). Twenty founding members participated in the first fruit and vegetable transformation training.  The group was originally part of a larger youth organization, whose projects were mostly run by young men.  The women wanted a project they could manage and use to earn an income.  As time went on, several women got married, moved, or simply left the group.  Five women remained motivated to create the business and run operations today.</p>
<p>The women involved range from 20 to 31-years-old and have varying levels of education.  The president of the group finished high school; the treasurer and secretary have elementary levels of education and the youngest of the group cannot read or write, but has learned to write the names of the products for record keeping.  The current president of the youth group, a 29-year-old man with a high school education, aids the group considerably in networking and business problem solving.</p>
<p>With only five committed members, the small group sized simplified organization and decision-making.  Additionally, all the women involved have support from their families, allowing them to take days off from cooking or laundry to make and sell the products in the market.  </p>

<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p> <a class="gallery" href="photos/juice3_700.jpg"><img src="photos/thumbs/juice3_200.jpg" id="floatright" border="0"/></a>The main products of G.I.E. Ndoucomane Productions consist of juices sold in bags for 50 FCFA or 100 FCFA (about 10 or 20 US cents), juice concentrates sold in bottles for 750 FCFA or 2,000 FCFA, and jams sold for 1,200 FCFA.  The clientele of the group varies along the product line:  
<p><strong>Bagged Juice</strong><br />
Bissap, Tamarin, Ginger, and Bouye are the most popular bagged juice flavors.  When in season, the women also make Mango, Ditax and Maad. The majority of bagged juices are sold in the Kaffrine market.  Two women walk around the market area selling from coolers, and a young man sells from a pushcart.  The group also sells their juice by command for weddings, baptisms, or school parties.  About 20 percent of their monthly sales comes from these special orders.</p>
<p><strong>Juice Concentrates</strong><br />
The group makes Bissap, Tamarin, Ginger and Ditax concentrates in 250mL and 1L bottles. The juice concentrates have the highest profit margin and are mostly sold to a store in Kaolack and expatriates at the semi-annual Artisan Expo in Dakar.  Current demand for the concentrates in Kaffrine is not high, but it is growing.  A boutique owner has recently started re-selling the concentrates with some success, and the group always keeps bottles on hand at their storefront.</p>
<p><strong>Jams and Jellies</strong> <br />
The jams are mostly sold at the expos to expatriates, tourists, and Peace Corps staff.  The glass jars pose a problem as they are expensive to buy and costly to transport to Kaffrine.</p>

<p> <a class="gallery" href="photos/juice2_700.jpg"> <img src="photos/thumbs/juice2_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft"/></a>PCVs helped launch this business through financing, marketing, and business management consultation. Initially, the group of women required outside financing for start-up capital.  The first volunteer (2004-2006) to work with the group provided connections to an NGO and government partners, who financed and provided the training, respectively. The next volunteer (2006-2008) acted as a day-to-day consultant and made market connections. The company expanded its clientele and connected to customers in the PC community.</p> 
<p>A constant PCV presence has helped the group learn business management, record keeping, and cost/benefit analysis throughout the progression of the business. The current volunteer (2008-2010) serves as a marketing and management consultant, helping the group use its accounting records to make business decisions, refine their distribution methods, and create marketing materials. Most recently, she helped establish a production and sales management system that assures workers will receive monthly payment.  The system keeps the individual group members motivated and accountable for their work.</p>
<p>Basic start-up costs for a project like this range from 120,000 cfa - 360,000 cfa. An NGO covered the start-up costs of a refrigerator, a selling cart, and materials used to make the products (the NGO no longer operates in Senegal).  A Peace Corps Partnership grant later financed the authorization numbers for each of the products, a color printer, and large pot to be used to make large quantities of juice and juice concentrates.</p> 

<p>Making concentrates only or producing juices for resale significantly decreases the start up costs as well as indirect costs later on.  Without the cost of a refrigerator, the needs for financial resources can be significantly reduced. </p>

<p>Basic start-up costs do not include the cost of an official training, which varies according to the trainer and the scope of the training. G.I.E. Ndoucomane Productions training was funded by the initial NGO partner and performed by the Institut de Technologie Alimentaire [www.ita.sn], which also certified the members as trainers.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>The women of G.I.E. Ndoucomane Production are in the black and have recorded profits since January 2010.  Although still facing challenges, the members of the group are taking home monthly salaries and the company continues to expand its sales base.  The current focus is on the bagged juices and increasing special orders for baptisms, weddings, and meetings.  </p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>The group is looking into ways to reduce their costs by buying their materials in bulk.  They are currently researching the feasibility of getting a small loan to increase their capital. </p>
