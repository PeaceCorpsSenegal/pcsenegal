<h1>Small Scale Trash Management Project</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><a href="photos/trash_1_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/trash_1_200.jpg" class="floatleft"></a>This project was designed to create a trash collection structure for the village of Ouarkhokh. The ultimate goal was to provide a clean and healthy environment through appropriate technology that can be maintain at the local level.  A donkey draw chart provided a house-to- house pick up service collecting four days a week. This project was managed by the community organization SOS SAHEL (an organization that addresses environmental problems particular to the Sahel region). The SOS SAHEL committee was in charge of employing someone to collect the trash, and take care of the donkeys.
Due to the reliance on community participation, the SOS SAHEL committee was also in charge of sensitizing the community to the health, environmental, economic, and social issues related to untreated solid waste as well as the benefits of composting. The SOS SAHEL committee collected 50 cfa, about 10 cents, for every trash pick up which allowed the project to be financially sustainable.</p>

<h3>The Context</h3>
<p><a href="photos/trash_2_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/trash_2_200.jpg" class="floatright"></a>In recent years, Senegal, like many other African countries, has seen a four fold increase in the amount of waste it generates due to population growth and the consequential purchase of packaged goods.  Though Ouarkhokh, about 2,000 people, is a relatively small community it has also seen a dramatic increase non-organic waste. There is no government solid waste management system within the region and there is a lack of knowledge of responsible waste management practices. Therefore community has been left to handle the increased amount waste by using improper practices.
The result has been the improper dumping of waste in five major dumping sites surrounding the village, the continuous littering of public areas and open burning of trash near residential areas which causes an increase in respiratory illnesses. The trash that was left in the streets and in the dumping areas creates a breeding ground for mosquitoes and flies that can spread malaria and diarrheal diseases. Diarrheal diseases can also be spread when young children play with the contaminated trash left in the streets.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>The project received funding from a Peace Corps Partnership grant to buy a cart, two donkeys and other start up materials. The donkey-drawn cart provided house-to-house trash pick up five days a week. The trash was then dumped in a large ditch just behind the village. In order to keep the project financially sustainable, the employee collects 50 cfa for each trash-pick up. The project was managed by the community organization SOS SAHEL, an organization that addresses environmental problems facing the community. The SOS SAHEL committee was in charge of employing someone to collect the trash and take care of all financial aspects of the ongoing project. The committee was also in charge of sensitizing the community on the dangers of untreated waste which included community cleanups a few times a month.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p><a href="photos/trash_3_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/trash_3_200.jpg" class="floatleft"></a>The community organization, SOS SAHEL, has taken ownership of the project and has shown great progress in the management aspect of this project. They have held monthly meetings to discuss the logistical aspects of the project and accounting aspects of the project.  The community has utilized the trash collection service. There were a few initial logistical problems such as, the employee not using the designated dump site and clients going over the three trash bin limit. These problems were later discussed at the monthly meeting and worked out among the committee members and the employee. This project was in the beginning stages and does not yet have concrete results.</p>

<h3>Next Step</h3>
<p>It is necessary to follow up with the SOS SAHEL committee to make sure they are handling the management aspect of the properly. It is also necessary to continue to educate the community about the importance of trash management. If the trash pick-up continues to be successful and the SOS SAHEL is managing the project well, the composting could be added. This would mean that every house would separate their trash into organic and non-organic waste. The organic material would be made into compost and later sold to local farmers.</p>

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>Behavior change is a long process. Although the village members used the trash collection service, their relationship with trash did not change. Littering was still very common and non-organic trash was not seen as a major environmental problem. This is why continued education is so important.</p>
