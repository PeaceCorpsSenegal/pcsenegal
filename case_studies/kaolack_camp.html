<H1>Kaolack Girls' Leadership Camp</H1>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Peace Corps volunteers from the regions of Fatick, Kaffrine, and Kaolack held a weeklong camp for twenty-seven high school aged girls.  Girls from all three regions spent the week at a campement outside of Sokone learning about concepts such as self identity, gender roles and equality, environmental protection, health, and communication so that they could become more informed and stronger leaders in their communities. </p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/kaolackcamp_001_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/kaolackcamp_001_200.jpg" id="floatleft" border="0" /></a>Across Senegal, girls' education is often considered to be of secondary importance to boys' education and girls are not encouraged to excel in school and become leaders.  Communities that have confidant, educated women are stronger and more successful.  Therefore the volunteers of the regions decided to organize a camp that would encourage and help girls develop leadership skills.  The goals of the camp were to instill self confidence in the girls and provide them with an opportunity to gain knowledge, learn new skills, and be exposed to new ideas to help them become leaders in their communities. These girls would return to their communities and share what they had learned and use the new skills they acquired so that the camp would have a wider impact than just the twenty-seven girls who attended.</p>


<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/kaolackcamp_003_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/kaolackcamp_003_200.jpg" id="floatright" border="0" /></a>Girls who had just completed the second year of secondary school were selected by volunteers with the help of school principals based on their academic achievement, motivation, and leadership potential.  These girls were invited to spend a week at a leadership camp in Sokone which was funded by a Peace Corps Partnership grant.  The camp took place at a campement located on the Sine Saloum Delta, approximately five kilometers outside the town.  Each day of the camp focused on a daily theme and the activities for the day were based on that theme.  The five themes included identity, health and fitness, environmental awareness, gender, and communications.</p>
  
<p>Each day began with leadership and teambuilding activities such as tug-of-war, trust falls, and simon says.  These were games and activities which required the girls to work together and got them motivated for the rest of the day.   The rest of the morning was spent in an information session on the theme of the day.  Senegalese guest speakers were invited each day to discuss these issues from a local point of view.  The afternoon started with crafts activities relevant to the theme of the day.  For example on environment day, the girls created a tree nursery and on health day the girls learned how to make a natural mosquito repellent.  Each day the girls participated in sports or swimming to encourage physical fitness.  The night ended with activities such as campfires and spa nights to help them unwind after a busy day.<a class="gallery" href="photos/kaolackcamp_002_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/kaolackcamp_002_200.jpg" id="floatleft" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>The girls were split into three groups and each group was led by a counselor who was a teacher from the local high schools.  Throughout the week, under the guidance of their counselors the girls wrote and practiced skits to demonstrate what they had learned during the camp.  The skits encompassed all of the themes that had been discussed during the camp.  The skits along with their daily journals and group discussions with their counselors caused the girls to reflect on how the lesson of the day applied to their daily lives.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/kaolackcamp_005_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/kaolackcamp_005_200.jpg" id="floatright" border="0" /></a>The change in the girls after just one week was evident.  They left more confident, motivated, and with more knowledge.  This could be seen in their attitudes and in the skits that they presented.  They understood the information that had been presented to them and were able to turn it into skits that showed how it applied to their everyday lives.</p>
<p>A secondary benefit of the camp was the transfer of knowledge to the teachers who participated as counselors.  They learned new activities and teaching methods from the volunteers and intend on incorporating them into their classes once the school year recommences.  They have also discussed what they learned with their colleagues who were interested and plan to use it in their lessons plan as well.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>All of the girls from the camp will be invited to a day-long follow up in the spring so that the volunteers can learn how the girls have applied what they learned.  It will also be a day for the girls to discuss any issues they have encountered since the camp and reunite with the friends they made from other towns.  Next summer a second camp will be held for a second larger group of girls.  The same teachers will be invited back as counselors and will take a larger role in planning and leading camp activities.  In addition, new teachers will be invited to come as counselors.</p>
