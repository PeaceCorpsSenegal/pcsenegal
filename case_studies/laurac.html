<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><img src="photos/thumbs/laurac_02_220.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" />In partnership with Malaria No More, PCV Laura Coberly, Daba Thiam, Modu Mane and Malamine Mansaly educated the communities of Thiamene Khall, Nguie and Sokone in Malaria prevention and distributed 500 long-lasting insecticide treated nets.  The villages of Thiamene Khall and Nguie now have universal mosquito net coverage, and ten talibe houses in Sokone have universal coverage.</p>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>Before the nets arrived, PCV Laura Coberly discussed Malaria prevention in the village of Thiamene Khall, and taught the women of the village how to make organic mosquito repellent (niim lotion).  In addition, the villages of Thiamene Khall, Nguie and the ten talibe houses in Sokone were instructed in proper mosquito net maintenance and usage. The number of mosquito nets needed was based on the actual number of beds in each community, which was calculated prior to raising the necessary funding for the nets.</p>  
<h3>Distribution</h3>
<p><img src="photos/thumbs/laurac_05_150.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" />The distribution began in the village of Nguie, approximately 2 kilometers west of Sokone.  PCV Laura Coberly, PCV Candice Whittaker and Modu Mane (of Nguie) went to every household individually, and placed an opened mosquito net on every bed to ensure full coverage.  One mosquito net was properly hung up by Modu Mane in every household as a demonstration, to ensure that everyone understood how they were supposed to be used.  In addition, while hanging the demonstration net, further emphasis was placed on how to properly care for and maintain the nets.  136 nets were distributed in Nguie, resulting in universal coverage.</p>
<p>The second distribution took place in the village of Thiamene Khall, approximately 4 kilometers east of Sokone.  245 nets were transported from Sokone to the village via charet.  Upon arrival, one member from every household arrived and collected the number of nets that corresponded with the number of beds in their household.  PCV Laura Coberly and Daba Thiam (of Thiamene Khall) facilitated the distribution.  Prior to receiving the nets the villagers were instructed in proper mosquito net maintenance and care.  The villagers explained their competency in how to hang mosquito nets and it was therefore deemed unnecessary to hang a net in every household as a demonstration.  At the end of the day, the village of Thiamene Khall had universal mosquito net coverage.</p>
<p><img src="photos/thumbs/laurac_03_220.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" />The third distribution took place in the town of Sokone.  As Sokone is a community with a population of 16,000 it would have been difficult to provide mosquito nets to every household; therefore PCV Laura Coberly and Malamine Mansaly (of Sokone) decided that it would be best to distribute mosquito nets to ten talibe houses in Sokone.  The talibe houses of Sokone house children of very young ages, and are generally of a very simple nature.  The children sleep on mats rather than on proper beds, and it is very rare for said mats to have a mosquito net.  Also, since the houses are primarily for children to study the Quran, it would be virtually impossible for them to find the means to own mosquito nets without outside assistance.</p>
<p>The distribution of nets in Sokone was similar to the Nguie distribution.  PCV Laura Coberly and Malamine Mansaly transported the appropriate number of nets to the respective talibe houses, and placed one opened mosquito net on every bed/mat to ensure universal coverage.  For every talibe house, one mosquito net was hung as a demonstration of proper hanging; mosquito net maintenance and care was reiterated during this demonstration period as well.  The distribution of nets to the ten talibe houses in Sokone took two days.  119 nets were distributed and the ten talibe houses of Sokone have universal net coverage.</p>
<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>Various organizations often provide mosquito nets for pregnant/nursing women and very young children in Senegal; however it leaves everyone else without coverage.  The communities of Thiamene Khall, Nguie and Sokone were very appreciative of the universal coverage.  As the mosquito nets were very recently distributed, and as the rainy season has not yet approached, there has not been any data on malaria rates within the communities.</p>
