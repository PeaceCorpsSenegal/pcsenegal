<h1>Saare Aboudou Community Garden and Orchard </h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/garden_1_451.png" ><img src="photos/thumbs/garden_1_200.png" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a>The community of Saare Aboudou needs to increase income generation, use the land more efficiently, and enhance the nutritional quality of their diets.  Community members decided that a  community garden annd orchard would help to fill these needs. The goal of the project was creating a space for people to have individual garden plots within a larger garden that includes some fruit trees on the perimeter and scattered throughout; thus allowing people to make money, be healthier, and be a more cohesive community. </p>
<p>So far, the project involved the clearing and fencing of a hectare of land, the construction of three cement-lined wells, building a bamboo tool shed, establishing tree nurseries, seeding vegetables for rainy season, and the formation of a functional Community Garden Committee.  Future activities include: groups trainings by experienced gardeners, planting of live fencing, out-planting fruit trees, and year round gardening and maintenance.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/garden_2_451.png" ><img src="photos/thumbs/garden_2_200.png" border="0" class="floatright" /></a>Saare Aboudou is a small Fulakunda and Pulafuta village located about 14km southeast of Kounkane, in the department of Velingara, region of Kolda.  About 400 people live in the community and make a living by subsistence farming. A long dry season dictates that villagers can only produce income by farming for a third of the year.  Diets are limited to field crops (corn, millet, rice, and peanuts), the few vegetables (okra and hibiscus) grown during the rainy season, and locally collected leaves.  Income generation, adequate nutrition, cross-community communication, and land conservation are prominent issues in Saare Aboudou.  Efforts to effectively garden and plant fruiting trees in the past have been upset by lack of land protection, access to water, and money to purchase materials, tools, and seeds.</p>
<p>The new community garden in Saare Aboudou will impact the working proximity of community memebers, nutrition of the gardenersâ€™ households, their level of year round income, and demonstrate the sustainable potential of the land.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>After deciding that a community garden and orchard space was needed.  A Community Garden Committee (President: Samba Bwaaro, Adjoin President: Demba Balde, Treasurer: Yerro Gaano, and Adjoin Treasurer: Ibrahima Diow) was formed to handle decision-making, logistics, finances, problem solving, and organization. After two community meetings and several committee meetings a garden layout was decided upon and a Small Projects Assistance grant was written by the Peace Corps Volunteer (PCV). The garden layout was planned to be a square hectare enclosed by 400 meters of chain-link fencing, with a central well, two water holding basins, and a tool shed.  This layout provides protection to the garden space, water for year round cultivation, and a place for sharing of tools.  The garden was to be divided into 100 square meter (10mx10m) plots, with a community area set aside for tree nurseries and training activities. Villagers would pay 100fcfa per month for each plot they have to the Community Garden Committee.  The Community Garden Committee will oversee the use of funds to purchase garden supplies, maintain the garden fence and structures, as well as organize garden trainings for the community.  Also general workdays (land clearing, live-fence planting, etc.), group trainings, and year round cultivation would continue into the future.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/garden_3_451.png" ><img src="photos/thumbs/garden_3_200.png" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a>The Saare Aboudou Community Garden and Orchard space is located about one kilometer southwest of the village. At the beginning of March the Community Garden Committee began planning workdays for clearing the garden space.  By mid-March the land was cleared and on March 23, 2011, fencing and well construction materials were purchased, along with some tools on March 31, 2011.  Fence post holes were dug, posts cemented, and chain-link fencing installed between March 30, 2011 and April 14, 2011.  April 15th the bamboo tool shed was constructed to house the wheelbarrows and other tools donated by villagers.  At the Community Garden Committee meeting on April 15, 2011, it was decided that the community would rather have three cement-lined wells, than have one well with two basins.  So, more well construction materials were purchased on April 20, 2011.  New well diggers and masons were found by Yerro Gaano to do this labor.  The well construction began on April 25, 2011 and was completed on June 18, 2011.  The diggers and masons would stay in Saare Aboudou for 3-4 days at a time then leave for 3-5 days. In addition to creating the wells, they taught three young men in Saare Aboudou how to dig and construct cement-lined wells.  On May 7, 2011 a fruit tree nursery was established with the participation of 23 villagers.  Garden tools (shovels, rakes, picks, pitchforks, hoes, watering cans) and well accessories (bucket, pulleys, rope) were purchased on June 22nd.  On June 24, 2011 the Community Garden Committee held a large community meeting where people decided they wanted to plant tomato, bitter tomato, and peppers for the rainy season.  Seeds were purchased on June 27, 2011 and seedbed preparation training was held on June 29th with 26 people attending.</p>
<p>Through working on the garden (clearing land, digging fence post holes, etc.) and participating in Garden Committee meetings the people of Saare Aboudou have become more interconnected.  They are working together, communicating, and sharing information.  Also 16 men and 7 women learned how to do fruit tree (papaya, guava, mango, and cashew) nurseries.  And three young men in my village were taught how to dig wells and do cement lining of wells by an experienced mason from another village.  At the seedbed preparation training 17 men and 9 women learned how to establish seed nurseries for garden vegetables (tomatoe, bitter tomato, and peppers).  As the project continues and there are more garden trainings, people within the community will improved gardening abilities as well, specifically the 21 men, 26 women, 3 boys, and 4 girls that have been actively participating in community garden work and meetings.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/garden_4_450.png" ><img src="photos/thumbs/garden_4_200.png" border="0" class="floatright" /></a>The Community Garden Committee will continue to organize garden trainings on digging techniques, proper plant spacing, companion planting, permagardening, organic fertilizers, specific plant needs, identifying pests, integrated pest management, water conservation techniques, landscaping techniques, crop rotations, and more.  The planting of live-fence trees (jatropha, moringa, and acacia) will be done on July 25 & 29, 2011.  Papaya and cashew trees will be out-planted in August, with the guava and mango trees to be out-planted next year. Committee and community meetings about the garden will continue.  Year-round gardening will benefit the entire community of Saare Aboudou.  With the Community Garden Committee in place to plan the workdays, training events, assign responsibilities, hold community meetings, and make final decisions regarding garden planning and purchasing this community garden ad orchard should be sustainable.  The Committee has already started collecting 100fcfa per month from each person who wants to participate in the garden.  This money will be used to purchase tools, do repairs, and routine maintenance.  Future nutrition causeries will also be linked with the community garden and the production of vegetables and fruit. </p>

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/garden_5_451.png" ><img src="photos/thumbs/garden_5_200.png" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a>To do a big project like this it is necessary to have a strong decision-making body, such as the Community Garden Committee.  With local people in charge of garden planning, organization, and other activities the project is much more likely to be durable.  However, it also takes control away from the PCV, which creates time frame, layout, and laborer changes.  For example, the committee decided they would rather have three wells, instead of one well with two basins.  So, it was necessary to buy more materials and find different well diggers and a new well mason.  Also the Community Garden Committee is more effective at collecting the monetary contributions for community members than a PCV.  For future projects like this, it is important to have a committee or individual who is in charge of garden activities.  Also make sure that everyone agrees upon the garden layout before the project begins, so there are no surprises.  The project also has an element of individuality which makes each person responsible and accountable for their own plot, so work gets done.</p>
