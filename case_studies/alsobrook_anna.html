<h1>2011 Tambacounda Region Annual Girls' Leadership Camp</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In response to gender inequity in education and limited opportunity for advancement for females in Senegal, Tambacounda region volunteers have collaborated again to organize the second annual girls' leadership camp for female, middle school-aged students.   The camp's primary focus was on acquisition of leadership skills, decision-making strategies, and the importance of continuing girls' education.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/girlscamp_1_720.jpg" ><img src="photos/girlscamp_1_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a>In Senegal as a whole, girls' education is an undervalued commodity.  Its importance is severely under-recognized, and proof of such disdain can be seen in the sheer difference of numbers between educated males and females.   Girls are expected to contribute most of their time to household tasks- cooking, cleaning, getting water.   Any time outside of household duties is typically considered unimportant and wasteful.  Such responsibilities are to better prepare girls for the families into which they will marry.</p>

<p>Continuing school through the teenage years is a new phenomenon, and girls are not always supported or encouraged by their families.  While there is gender parity in primary education in the area, statistics show that the ratio of female to male students drastically declines in middle and high school. In addition, those who are able to continue their studies struggle to balance school work and their domestic responsibilities.</p>

<p>To address these issues and to build on previous gender development work in their communities, Peace Corps volunteers from around Tambacounda decided to collaboratively organize a girls' leadership weekend.  The camp served as an educational tool to promote leadership skills, decision-making strategies, education and career planning, and also as a celebration of their dedication to scholarly endeavors despite outside obligations.</p>

<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/girlscamp_3_720.jpg" ><img src="photos/girlscamp_3_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatright"></a>Tambacounda Girls' Camp, funded entirely by a SPA grant, took place on the weekend of April 8-10, 2011 in Tambacounda, Senegal.  The dates fell in the wake of vacation due to the April 4 holiday of Senegalese independence.  This worked to the girls' advantage, as they did not have to miss school in order to get to Tamba for the camp.  Volunteers from throughout the region invited 1-3 girls from their respective colleges to participate in the camp.  Each girl was also allowed to bring one guest, preferably the father. Typically, fathers misunderstand or disregard the importance of girls' education more than most family members. They are the ones who promise their daughters to early marriage. They are the ones who receive the bride price.  They especially need to be enlightened on the value of increased women's education.</p>

<p>In total, fourteen girls, as well as their fathers, were invited to the event, held at the Maison d'Ouvres in Tamba.  The participants and their guests arrived Friday night, and were greeted by Awa Traore and the Peace Corps volunteers.  Games and music were played, followed by dinner, and a screening of Elle Travaille, Elle Vit.   After the movie, Awa led a small group discussion and question and answer session based on its themes.</p>

<p>The following day, the girls and their fathers/guests attended a joint session led by Awa Traore, discussing the importance of keeping their daughters in school and the difficulties that excessive obligations in the household create for serious students.  They also broke into groups to discuss early marriage, their perspectives on it, and how it affects their lives.  In the second, morning session, we had a panel of guest speakers comprised of influential women in the surrounding area.   They consisted of a banker, a Tostan worker, and spoke of setting and attaining life goals.  The afternoon session for the girls was spent reflecting the panelists' discussion, and creating career/future goals for themselves. To do so, they drew their interests and aspirations on butcher paper and then discussed their drawings in front of the group.  After all the participants revealed their personal goals, the following discussion was based on immediate and long-term steps in which to help achieve those goals.  In order to help retain and realize these steps, the girls then wrote letters to their future selves, detailing exactly what it was that they hoped to achieve.  The evening was spent in a more relaxing manner.  Volunteers led sessions on how to make moringa beignets and friendship bracelets.</p>

<p>Sunday morning, the fathers had a special session with Awa intimately discussing the importance of keeping their daughters in school and delaying early marriage.  The girls, meanwhile, spent the morning having fun and learning American music and dance moves.  Afterwards, there was a joint session with the girls and their fathers.  Here, the girls each confronted their fathers, with the help of their drawings from the previous day, with what it is that they want out of their lives and how exactly they wish to attain it.  Awa led this session, instigating communication between father and daughter with insightful and thought-provoking questions for both sides.  Every girl had the chance to speak her own mind to her father, and every father had the chance to do the same.  By doing so, girls were given the opportunity to stand up for themselves, while the fathers were able to see a small sign of the woman their daughters will become.   The session proved to be extremely successful.   Most of the participants, as well as all the volunteers, said it was the highlight of the weekend.  The camp ended with a group photo and lunch.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/girlscamp_4_720.jpg" ><img src="photos/girlscamp_4_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatright"></a>The goals of the project were to give the girls an opportunity to envision and plan for their futures, to help them acquire confidence and decision-making skills that will help them overcome future challenges, including early and forced marriage, violence (including harassment and rape), poverty and a lack of resources, and to encourage them to continue their studies and strive to meet their potential.</p>

<p>Observation and community and participant feedback has shown that the camp was extremely successful not only in providing the individual girls with new skills and information, but also in creating awareness within the communities of the importance of female education and leadership. For some of the girls, this was the first time they were able to participate in an open dialogue with their peers and fathers about the challenges they face and the women they hope to become.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/girlscamp_1_720.jpg" ><img src="photos/girlscamp_5_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatleft"></a>Volunteers have followed up on the camp by giving the participants the letters they wrote to themselves at the beginning of the following school year. They have also dedicated time to working with the participants in their villages through gender development activities and occasional youth groups.  Additionally, each volunteer has also resolved to establish a supporting relationship with the girls' fathers, in order to continually promote the ideals set forth at the camp.</p>

<p>In future years, area volunteers will continue to facilitate the annual Tamba Girls' Camp for middle school-aged girls, as well as their fathers.  Each year, as they plan for these camps, volunteers will reflect on the success and effectiveness of past ones in order to refine and improve the model.  Additionally, in future years, first and second year volunteers will collaborate in order to ensure the continuation and improvement of this project amid frequent volunteer turnover.</p>

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>Budget problems were a limiting factor for the camp.  It was hard to attain the 25% community contribution required of every SPA grant.  In the camp debriefing, volunteers brainstormed additional ideas on how to calculate/quantify community contribution, including donations of the speakers' time, partial reimbursements for travel based on percentage, and a field trip to the local lycee.  Flexible scheduling was another valuable lesson learned.  Many times Awa's sessions went longer than expected or the power and water would go out, and things would have to be switched or removed.  Volunteers also would like to incorporate a trip to the local lycee and a session with the principal to discuss the process and details of going to high school.</p>
