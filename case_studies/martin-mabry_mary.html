<h1>Suxali Basket Weaving</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p><img src="photos/thumbs/mabry_05_200.jpg" alt="Mary Martin-Mabry" class="floatleft"/>Women in the region northeast of Thies have been weaving traditional baskets of reed and recycled plastic strips for generations. These baskets can be seen throughout the country, and most originate from the villages surrounding Ngaye-Mekhe and Tivaouane. With some help from Peace Corps Volunteers, Association And Suxali, a community-based group of female artisans, has been exporting their products to the United States since 2007. The collaboration has firmly established an overseas market that provides a secure source of income for women who may otherwise be unable to provide food for their family. The baskets are a traditional handicraft woven almost exclusively by largely illiterate women who live in small villages that do not have running water or electricity. The baskets are made from locally harvested sea grass and plastic strips from a prayer mat factory in Dakar, funneling money back to all members of the community, from the farmers to the weavers to the drivers who transport orders from the villages to the Port of Dakar. </p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>Diama Thiendou is a village located about 40 kilometers northeast of Thies in an area known for this unique handwoven craft. After the needless loss of a child to malaria in 2007, the community formed Association And Suxali to bring improved access to basic services.  While initially a multifaceted association focused on food transformation, animal husbandry and more, artisanal products proved to be the villages’ strength. </p>

<p><a href="photos/mabry_01_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/mabry_01_250.jpg" alt="Mary Martin-Mabry" class="floatright"/></a>Baskets are a longstanding tradition in the area and typically sold in a large weekly market . The association’s linkages to overseas markets changed the standard mode of business.  Belonging to an association means women do not need to travel to the markets to sell their wares; they can stay at home and take care of their children while they weave. Committed to providing above average wages to the women weavers, Suxali is restoring proﬁts back to the artisans' community rather than intermediaries who seek to drive down prices then resell for proﬁt. Since the start of this project with Peace Corps Volunteer partnerships in 2007, there has been a noticeable change in standard of living for all villages involved.</p>

<h3>The Approach</h3>

<p><a href="photos/mabry_02_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/mabry_02_200.jpg" alt="Mary Martin-Mabry" class="floatleft"/></a>Peace Corps involvement with Association And Suxali has transformed over the years since the associations inception.  PCV Pete Freeman (Ngaye-Mekhe) was initially approached by the association for assistance and helped to establish a overseas market for the woven baskets and set basic pricing and wages.  PCV Dan Leffel (Tivaouane) conducted a feasibility study to gauge the effect of the association on the community and ensure that expanding this business was environmentally sustainable. PCV Oliver Gaines (Ngaye-Mekhe) continued this work and updated the accounting method to include a portion of profits be reinvested into the association.  Wages were recalculated based on material costs and daily labor. PCV’s assisted the association with quality control and shipping logistics and were able to finance the construction of a large storage shed through a Peace Corps Partnership grant in 2010.</p>

<p>With the help of the current generation of PCVs, Christine Lee (Tivaouane) and Mary Martin-Mabry (Ngaye-Mekhe), the association is transitioning to being a hundred percent self-sustaining with regards to this project.  Suxali has joined an artisanal association network based out of Thies which meets monthly to discuss upcoming opportunities to showcase artisanal products and share best practices.  Suxali is improving internal organization and financial management and has applied for financing from a worldwide organization with a base in Dakar--Root Capital. Within the next year Suxali hopes to incorporate new clients and begin functioning without Peace Corps assistance. </p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>Suxali has been exporting to an American-based company for over three years now and orders have been steady. Interest has increased recently and Suxali is in negotiations with a few European buyers as well.  The Association has been able to provide a steady income to not only women weavers, but local village men involved in packaging and transport.  With each order a portion of the profit is funneled back into the organization’s savings account, used not only to sustain the association but also support community led projects. As orders have grown, Suxali has been able to expand their operation, working with more villages and employing more women in each. </p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>

<p><a href="photos/mabry_03_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/mabry_03_200.jpg" alt="Mary Martin-Mabry" class="floatleft"/></a>Suxali works with approximately ten villages between Tivaouane and Ngaye-Mekhe.  As demand has grown, the woman weavers have been unable to keep up with the pace of orders. Suxali has been slowly adding more villages to the association in an attempt to address the issue, but not all women are trained in the specific styles requested resulting in problems with quality and uniformity. To ameliorate the difficulties, Suxali has organized a series of trainings with some of the most experienced weavers to teach and share techniques with the newer women.  This process is time consuming but proving necessary and helpful as an increasing amount of women become involved with the association. This idea of training and development was started in 2010 with the help of two West Africa Trade Hub (USAID) funded design consultants who were sent to the villages to train the women on quality control and product development. </p>

<p>In 2010, Suxali saw an exponential increase in interest and orders from overseas buyers. As the basket production started to see a bottleneck, it also faced similar management problems in that most of the accounting and liaison duties were delegated to one person, the Vice President. Throughout the year, the association slowly increased the number of village supervisors, lead women who can delegate work, money, and materials, as well as managers. Currently, they are working with two full-time managers who manage order production and salaries, and one Vice President who continues to handle all accounting, marketing, and client customer service.  </p>

<p>Due to volatility in the market, Suxali has had difficulty securing materials in recent months.  As their stock dwindles they are delinquent and at times unable to fill orders to which they have previously committed.  While they have explained this situation to displeased but understanding clients, this practice is unsustainable if they hope to keep orders coming.  Suxali must begin purchasing large quantities of materials in advance to avoid shortages due to unforeseen problems. However, purchasing large stock requires a huge financial input that can no longer come in the form of client advances.  Clients as well as the volunteers have suggested that Suxali find a source of outside funding to maintain stock and bolster production.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p><a href="photos/mabry_04_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/mabry_04_200.jpg" alt="Mary Martin-Mabry" class="floatright"/></a>Suxali's orders have been growing in recent months and there has been increased interest in the baskets from European clients. The association has sought help from Root Capital, a micro-finance company specializing in loans to start-up companies in West Africa. Suxali is working actively with Bamba Fall, a former SED technical trainer with the Peace Corps, and current Root Capital representative to secure a loan with the company.  They hope to be approved in the upcoming months in order to purchase a large stock of materials necessary to keep up with the burgeoning demand. In the future, Suxali hopes to be financially solvent and able to produce large orders without advances from their clients, enhancing business relationships and production capability. </p>
