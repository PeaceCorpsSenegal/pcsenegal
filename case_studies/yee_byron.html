<h1>Oil Press Research and Production</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/oilpress_1_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/oilpress_1_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a>This was a Food Security project to research and develop appropriate technology for the production of oil.  This research and development will initially focus on the production of peanut and moringa oil, with sesame and possibly cashew oil research to follow.  The funding from this grant was used to purchase an oil press, other materials and supplies necessary for the preparation and extraction of oil, ground nuts, and other labor inputs.  The goals of this project were to design and manufacture a machine that optimizes oil production, as well as research the various costs and quantities of the inputs and outputs applied throughout the value chain and transformation process.</p>

<p>Community Value: The local community expressed interest in general food transformation; groundnuts are produced in large quantities by farmers in the region, which opens up a market for peanut production and transformation.</p> 

<h3>Context</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/oilpress_3_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/oilpress_3_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatright" /></a>Peanuts are produced at very high quantities in the delta region of Senegal (Fatick and Kaolack regions).  Due to the extremely high quantities of peanuts throughout the region, the market for groundnuts is driven down to a very cheap price, meaning farmers sell their product for very little income.  Food transformation focuses on creating and exploiting opportunities, adding value, and establishing jobs throughout the value chain of a specific product, in this case, peanuts.  Currently, this is not an actively pursued project; peanut farmers harvest their crops then wait to sell when there is finally a demand or when the price improves.  This puts all farmers in an economically unstable position, as the sale of their product is sometimes their only source of income, which is why pursuing activities such as oil production is vitally important to the economic activity of the community.</p>

<p>The production of oil directly affects several individuals in the value chain:<br/>
1.	Farmers produce raw groundnuts. (Oil creates sale opportunities)<br/>
2.	Labor is hired to shell the raw nuts. (Job creation)<br/>
3.	Nuts must be ground by machine/hand for oil extraction. (Job creation/supplementation)<br/>
4.	Oil extraction produces two saleable items: oil and press cakes fed to livestock (Income generation)<br/></p>

<p>Most of the small and midsized towns and villages in this region are primarily agricultural communities, so the sale of the peanuts and monetary income affects the rest of the town’s ability to conduct their general business.  As shown by the production process, the production and sale of oil creates jobs and spreads income throughout various workers.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/oilpress_2_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/oilpress_2_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a>PCV Byron Yee met with and discussed various press designs and details with 3 different metal workers in Kaffriene, Kaolack, and Karang respectively.  The goal of the project is to experiment with and determine the most ideal design in terms of efficiency, oil outputs, and total costs.  With the help of local community members, Yee first researched and learned how oil was traditionally made.  After learning about the entire process and necessary inputs and outputs, the next step was to build and order the actual press.  Yee used Food Security funds to purchase a press, but also tested oil production on several other press designs.</p>

<p>For a couple months, Yee ran tests on his personal press and then compared his data and numbers with other community members, and other presses. Finally, Yee conducted very basic market research and cost analysis to determine if oil production was profitable and by what margin.</p>


<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Using traditional local production techniques (steaming and pressing groundnuts twice), the following yields were universally reached, regardless of press modifications, designs, and size.</p>

<p>Afterwards, a cost analysis was run to determine what the operating costs were per kg of whole peanut and also per liter of oil produced. The results are that it costs about 630 FCFA to produce 1 liter of peanut oil.</p>

<p>Finally, a local market study was conducted to see if producing oil given the production costs and market prices would result in a profitable business venture. As seen below, the cost of production is well below any market price, meaning one could sell peanut oil for a minimum of 170 FCFA profit anywhere in this region (800 FCFA retail price – 630 FCFA costs = 170 FCFA profit).</p>

<h3>Next Step</h3>
<p>Yee successfully confirmed that peanut oil production is a profitable and feasible business venture. With just 100,000 FCFA (200 USD) startup capital to purchase equipment, one could run a fairly successful business with a product that would otherwise fail to create a significant or substantial income.  The next step is convincing and encouraging individuals to pursue this as a very promising income generating activity.  All the research and experimentation has just been completed, so this is not a risk that a local community member will need to take.  PCVs can now use this information on model types, startup capital, and production costs to help their local community members pursue these activities.</p>

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>People will show initial interest and excitement with any new project or piece of technology.  However, after this beginning curiosity wears off, there are few people who are truly interested in pursuing these activities as a serious business venture.  The main lesson learned is that the key to successful projects like these is immediately identifying and working with these members more and more as time progresses.  Convincing a community member to adopt a new activity or technology is the most challenging.  But if this can be accomplished and others start to see the results, it will be much easier for future expansion and promotion.</p>
