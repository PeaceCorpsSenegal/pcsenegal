<H1>Gym Launch in Tambacounda</H1>

<h3>Summary</h3><p><a class="gallery" href="photos/mamediarra_06_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/mamediarra_06_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" /></a>From December, 2009 to September, 2010, PCV Jessica Young worked with an entrepreneur in Tambacounda, Senegal to create a new start-up, a health and fitness center.  The immediate goals of the project were to provide the entrepreneur with business planning and management skills, launch a center to increase local fitness offerings, provide community members with personal training and safe physical fitness, and create a network between the Tamba gym and similar facilities across Senegal.  This case study is meant to provide a model for enterprise creation.  Volunteers seeking to help local entrepreneurs create new start-ups will find tips below for planning and project execution, as well as a sample timeline.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/mamediarra_01_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/mamediarra_01_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a>
Health fitness and sports training are large priorities in Tamba, as in most communities across Senegal. In the absence of a professional offering, makeshift weight lifting centers had been constructed.  Noting the large demand for fitness offerings, the PCV helped the entrepreneur conduct a feasibility study for a commercial gym.  Market research revealed that community members valued fitness as a tool for supporting their athletic and employment aspirations, health, self-confidence, pride and stress relief.  The community at large viewed fitness offerings at the time to be insufficient because handcrafted equipment was often dangerous, personal training was lacking, limited offerings lacked options for women and youth, and outdoor centers lacked electricity and protection from harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>The feasibility study indicated a commercial gym would be financially successful and beneficial to the community.  The PCV agreed to work with the entrepreneur to facilitate the launch of the enterprise which would have the goals of increasing access to fitness, gender inclusiveness in fitness, and local employment.  This project directly corresponded with the goals of the SED (Small Enterprise Development) Project Plan by creating a new business which would integrate business planning into business management, use a tailored recordkeeping system for budgeting and financial analysis, integrate marketing training into operations, and benefit from linkages to financial services and business contacts.</p>

<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/mamediarra_02_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/mamediarra_02_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright"/></a>
The following were the main objectives guiding project execution:<ul>
<li>create an enterprise offering products (equipment and pricing structures) meeting community needs</li>
<li>secure funding needed (using available grants and local resource assessment)</li>
<li>transfer business management and technical skills needed to run the business</li>
<li>take steps to ensure enterprise sustainability </li></ul></p>
<p>Implementation took roughly nine months.<br /></p>
<ul><li>In December of 2009, initial marketing research was conducted.  The entrepreneur established his target market, determined consumer needs and conducted inventory price comparisons.</li>
<li>From February to April, 2010 the PCV and entrepreneur developed a business plan.  </li>
<li>From June to August, 2010 a fundraising campaign was conducted.  The PCV and entrepreneur created a fundraising video to illustrate community need and generate interest in the project by private and corporate sponsors.  Online fundraising took place through the Peace Corps Partnership Program (PCPP).</li>
<li>In August of 2010, the PCV led a month of intensive GERME business trainings with the entrepreneur.  The GERME trainings were highly beneficial for elaborating on ideas already presented in the business plan and reinforcing important business concepts.  The trainings covered how to use amortization, determine operating costs, fix pricing, set target sales, apply marketing, use accounting and identify long-term business goals.  After topics were covered, the entrepreneur applied the material by creating recordkeeping systems and templates to be used when the business opened.  Copies of the GERME trainings were left with the entrepreneur as a resource for future reference.</li>
<li>In September of 2010, the entrepreneur participated in technical exchanges with gym owners and personal trainers in Thies and Dakar.  Next, equipment was purchased, transported and assembled.  A ‘soft opening’ was conducted before the ‘grand opening,’ leaving time for promotion by word of mouth, radio programming, sign creation and printed materials.  On opening day, the center was open to the public for free demonstrations and entrance fees were charged starting day two.  </li></ul></p>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/mamediarra_04_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/mamediarra_04_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" /></a>To ensure project sustainability, the following measures were taken: a strong marketing campaign was developed to ensure substantial traffic; the entrepreneur received counsel regarding mechanical setup and equipment repairs; an amortization system was established for depreciating equipment; the center was staffed with management, marketing and maintenance teams; and to address legal requirements, a business license was obtained and all receipts showing property ownership were secured.</p>
<p>The following tips would be advisable for someone trying to implement a similar project:<br />
<ul><li>Leave ample time for securing a business license.  Processing can take as little as 2-3 days, but other certificates may be needed depending on the entrepreneur’s situation.  (For example, if the entrepreneur is required to produce a marriage certificate not yet obtained, processing could take an additional month or more.)</li>
<li>Take precautions when transporting merchandise.  A stamped receipt should always accompany the merchandise to prove ownership, and to minimize friction at customs checkpoints, a letter from the Ministry of the Interior is desirable.</li>
<li>Focus on sales projections and financial planning as this can be one of the most difficult training areas.  Entrepreneurs may be reluctant to state numbers, hesitant to “lie” should their numbers be inaccurate.  Illustrating the benefit of financial planning becomes easier when comparing sales forecasts to the break-even sales needed to meet operating costs.  </li>
<li>Marketing before launch may prove difficult.  Customers may be hesitant to believe the promised product offering will truly be available without first seeing it.  For this reason, a ‘soft opening’ may be beneficial where a marketing team and select community members test out the product before conducting word of mouth publicity.  This will give the business credibility and hype before the grand opening.  </li>
<li>Maximize information sharing and technical skill transfer.  Working through a business plan is a great way to introduce business concepts before GERME trainings, gauge the entrepreneur’s interest and commitment, and to outline a concrete plan with steps to follow and a calendar for implementation.  Connecting the entrepreneur to similar business owners across the country is an excellent means of best practice sharing among successful businesses; entrepreneurs from distant regions are more likely to share their tips for success as they have less reason to worry about the new entrepreneur creating direct competition.</li></ul></p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/mamediarra_05_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/mamediarra_05_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a>As a result of this project, a new start-up was launched providing a highly demanded product improving local health and creating the need for 6 new jobs.  Community members developed new skills in business planning and management, recordkeeping and accounting and technical skills regarding personal training and safety.  Networks were created with center owners in Thies and Dakar and aspects of their business models have been incorporated into that of the Tamba center.  The new fitness center introduced both cardio and weight lifting rooms helping it attract an average of 70 clients per day upon its launch.  In its first few days of operation alone, center sales reached over $100.</p>
<br />
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>The fitness center plans to expand to a larger center serving more clientele with more equipment.  Management will use an amortization system to replace equipment as needed and make repairs.  With gym expansion, the owner hopes to create new jobs and continuously add complementary services to meet client needs including aerobics classes.</p>
