<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Working with the University of Bambey and local teachers, ten Peace Corps volunteers in the Thies area created a week-long summer camp for thiry-three high-achieving middle school girls. The camp used health discussions, business classes, environmental awareness, and community building to the girls different ways to reach their potential. </p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/Bambey_002_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/Bambey_002_200.jpg" border="0" align="right" id="floatright" /></a>The participating girls represented the best from their six middle schools in Bambey, Keur Demba Kébé, Mboro, and Pout. They received
the highest grades in their schools but often lack support from their families and communities. </p>
<p>Whether the girls are from a larger town or a small village, when they are not in school, these girls help with cooking, 
cleaning, and raising their younger siblings. With a workload often double that of their male peers, middle school girls often drop out before 
completing high school and are left without  practical skills to support themselves. </p>


<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p>Ten Peace Corps volunteers from the Thies area partnered with the University of Bambey and the Center for University Usage of the University of Senegal to create a week-long camp. The university
system provided free lodging and classroom use; the rest of the project was funded by donations from friends and family in
the US. By working with the target communities, the volunteers and their counterparts created a varied curriculum for the camp. At the
end of September 2010, thirty-three girls ranging from 12-17 years old gathered at the University of Bambey.</p>  
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/Bambey_001_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/Bambey_001_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a>The entire week was themed "Our World, Our Future" and each day had a corresponding idea. Thefirst day, "Our World, Our Health" included
discussions on healthy environments and allowed the girls to ask health questions.
The afternoon was filled with games and races to promote active living.  Focused on the future, the second day started with a panel of
professional Senegalese women who answered the girls' questions. Often the questions involved the balance between having a family, adhering to
cultural expectations, and still pursuing your goals.</p>
<p>Awa Traore, Peace Corps Cultural Director, also gave a presentation on a woman's role and the ability to achieve one's potential even when 
societal pressures might stand in the way. Using recycled water bottles for vegetable garden containers, the girls discussed food security and environmental protection during the "Our World, Our Environment" day. The final day focused on the idea of business. The girls discussed their ideas of enterprise in Senegal and also played a role-playing business game. In addition, the girls created lip balm and Neem lotion, a mosquito repellent. They discussed how each of these items could be sold in their communities to supplement their families' incomes.  Each day involved art projects and team building games to encourage community development.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/Bambey_004_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/Bambey_004_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" /></a>By the end of the week, the girls had learned a variety of skills and created a support network. Theyreturned home with examples of realistic projects they could incorporate in their daily lives.
Several girls are working to set-up small businesses aimed at selling products to their classmates and in their neighborhood. Other girls are hoping to improve
their families'nutrition with vegetables grown in recycled-bottle gardens. Each girl left with renewed vigor towards her academic pursuits
and the pride of being part of a new community of young, intelligent girls.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/Bambey_003_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/Bambey_003_200.jpg" border="0" align="left" class="floatleft" /></a>Over the next few months, volunteers will continue to do follow-up work with the girls who want to start gardening or selling Neem lotion.
Girls' groups are also being formed so campers can pass their new knowledge to their classmates who did not attend the camp. In addition to maintaining the camp, the Senegalese counterparts and volunteers are interested in expanding the program. Work is being done
to continue partnering with the Center for University Usage to spread the camp to other campuses around Senegal. The volunteers and
counterparts are also working on a how-to manual for future projects.</p>
