<h1>Koumpentoum English Camp</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Over the course of two days in May, Peace Corps Volunteers conducted a camp for students of the high school and several middle schools within the department of Koumpentoum.  The goal was to give the students, most of whom already spoke English at an intermediate level, the opportunity to practice using the language while learning about topics of local importance including HIV/AIDS prevention, health and nutrition, the environment, and planning for the future.  Local English teachers were heavily involved in the planning and also led the discussions dealing with HIV/AIDS and decision-making skills.  In total, the camp was attended by 87 students (24 of whom traveled to Koumpentoum from surrounding villages) and 12 teachers (6 from villages), and was facilitated by 7 Peace Corps Volunteers from the sectors of small enterprise development, health, sustainable agriculture, and agroforestry.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/englishcamp_1_448.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/englishcamp_1_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatright" /></a>The Senegalese education system is faced with several challenges.  Large class size makes it difficult for teachers to give students individual attention and to effectively hold in-class discussions.  Also, the limited resources in Senegal hinder activity-based learning.  The camp was structured to give students the opportunity to participate in small-group discussions with their peers and also in activities where they would work with native English speakers.  The English-language theme was very appealing as many young Senegalese express a desire to visit Europe or the United States.  Sessions were each designed to target a specific local problem: HIV transmission, malaria, malnutrition, pollution, etc.  Painting murals relating to these themes on the second day of camp was intended to serve as a reminder of these issues in the future.</p>

<p>Another broad goal was to encourage individual students to continue their education.  Middle-school students from surrounding villages were given the opportunity to interact with their peers from other towns and to be a part of the Koumpentoum high school community.  Hopefully, this will encourage more of them to continue their education through the high school level and beyond.  Additionally, as part of the closing ceremony of the camp, individual winners from a prior competition held by local English clubs were recognized.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>

<p>Since the goal was to reach a large number of students, it was indispensible that local teachers and student leaders shoulder a large part of the responsibilities in organizing the event.  Teachers and student members of the English club in Koumpentoum were placed in charge of making arrangements for the weekend's meals, providing accommodations for students and teachers that were traveling for the camp, and renting the sound system and tents.</p>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/englishcamp_2_448.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/englishcamp_2_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a>Teachers from Koumpentoum and the villages teamed up to lead the sessions on HIV/AIDS prevention and decision-making.  The material for these lessons was taken from previous Peace Corps activities and incorporated topics including early/forced marriage, condom use and abstinence, gender roles, and impediments to education in Senegalese society.  In the decision-making session, small groups of 4-5 students each received a hypothetical situation and had to discuss how they would approach it.  They then presented their conclusions to other students.  The camp was broken into groups so that only 20 students were in the room at a time for this discussion.  In the HIV/AIDS session, a series of videos from <a href="http://www.scenariosfilms.com" target="_blank">scenariosfilms.com</a> was shown.  After each scenario was presented, students answered questions about the characters and behavior in the film.</p>

<p>After the classroom sessions, small groups of students presented skits to their peers.  These had been prepared before coming to the camp and dealt with the themes which were being discussed throughout the weekend.  Students were very enthusiastic about presenting in English and talking about issues important to them.  After dinner, an English-language movie was shown for entertainment.</p>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/englishcamp_3_448.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/englishcamp_3_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatright" /></a>The following morning, students split into groups to paint educational murals on the wall of the school compound.  Peace Corps Volunteers demonstrated the use of grids to enlarge designs in order to paint them on the wall.  Next, Volunteers led an activity fair to teach participants about environmental and health issues.  Sessions included demonstrations of how to make natural insect repellent from neem trees and how to cook beignets using the highly nutritious moringa tree.  Also, students decorated reusable cloth bags that had been made with scrap fabric from local tailors; this was to encourage them to use fewer plastic bags when they go shopping and to think of ways to make use of material that would otherwise go to waste.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/englishcamp_4_448.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/englishcamp_4_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a>The camp brought together 87 students and 12 teachers from the town of Koumpentoum and six surrounding villages.  Students had the chance to practice English outside of the classroom and present English skits to their peers.  Participants received practical demonstrations in moringa cooking and neem lotion preparation.  Each student received a cloth bag to encourage them to reduce waste in their communities.  Seven murals were painted on the school wall, including a world map and several health-themed designs.  All involved parties - students, teachers, administrators, and Peace Corps Volunteers - expressed satisfaction with the overall outcome of the camp.  Finally, this event served to raise exposure of Peace Corps projects in the department of Koumpentoum and will hopefully lead to follow-up projects with members of the school community.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/englishcamp_5_448.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/englishcamp_5_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatright" /></a>Several of the teachers from villages were enthusiastic about replicating these efforts at their local schools.  As four new volunteers were recently installed in the department of Koumpentoum, there is potential to advise them on how to carry out similar or follow-up projects in their villages.  One of the goals of inviting teachers from other villages, rather than students only, was to encourage them to collaborate at the department-wide level, and Peace Corps can support them in any ideas they come up with.  The Koumpentoum English camp could be repeated next year with different students, new themes (perhaps business training or a career fair in place of this year's health and environment focus), or additional activities.</p>

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>

<p>A project of this scope would be impossible without strong support from teachers and the community.  Two or three teachers ended up doing the bulk of the work to organize food and accommodations.  Students from the Koumpentoum English Club were eager to plan and participate in this event and created mural designs and skit ideas.  That being said, it takes more than dedicated participants to navigate the nuances of the Senegalese education system.  The schedule for the camp had to be changed less than a week prior to the event due to concerns from the School Inspector's office about students having to travel.  Ultimately, the office helped us obtain approval from administrators at the local, departmental, and regional levels on only a few days notice.  However, this last-minute rush could have been avoided by keeping officials at all levels informed continuously throughout the planning process.</p>

<p>One of the risks of having a co-ed camp is that activities and discussion will be dominated by the boys.  During the HIV/AIDS session, it was very difficult to get girls to speak up and share their opinions.  This may also have been because the teachers leading this session were all male.  It would have been better to have at least some female teachers leading the discussions, and might have even been better to split up the session by gender.</p>

<p>The registration process took much longer than expected.  Teachers had been asked to divide the students into four groups for the rotating sessions, however this was not intuitive for the teachers or was not explained clearly enough.  In the future, it would be better to have participants pre-registered or to have Peace Corps Volunteers handle this step directly.</p>

<p>While using a high school as event space ensures that there is a vested community contribution to the project, there are trade-offs with using a public space.  In this particular case, there was a soccer game going on simultaneously with the afternoon sessions, distracting the students, and it was difficult to keep disruptive young children from wandering into classrooms and activities.  A way to mitigate this in the future might be to plan separate activities specifically to occupy curious neighborhood children, like playing a movie or having coloring books in another room.</p>
