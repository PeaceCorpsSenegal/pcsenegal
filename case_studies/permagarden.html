<H1>Permagardening Training in Kolda</H1>

<h3>Summary</h3><p><a class="gallery" href="photos/Perma_Women_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/thumbs/Perma_Women_200.jpg" id="floatright" border="0" /></a> A Peace Corps volunteer and her counterparts facilitated a permagarden training in the Kolda demonstration garden in May 2010, introducing a new approach to home gardening that will aid in better <a href="?page=food_security/index.html">food security</a>. Popularized by Peace Corps Tanzania, permagardening is applicable to any garden location and is capable of producing higher crop yields using less space, thus making it easier for families to supplement their rice-based diets with vegetables. Extension of the permagardening method is relatively new for Peace Corps Senegal; thus, the training and its follow-up are works in progress for discovering which parts of the practice work best for Senegal and its many climates and soil types. </p><h3>Context</h3>
<p>Permagardening, a derivative of <a href="?page=food_security/permaculture.html">permaculture</a>, is an integrated technique for individual home gardens to better address rainfall, erosion, soil fertility, and food security problems. Permaculture seeks to create agricultural spaces that are self-sustaining mini-ecosystems by which problems are regulated from within the system, rather than relying on outside (and often expensive) inputs. </p>

<p>As in the rest of Senegal, many Kolda residents are not food secure. Even when families have money for food, most of it goes toward buying rice and bread, rather than vegetables or protein. Most urban and peri-urban <a href="?page=food_security/gardens.html">gardeners</a> use the traditional mono-cropping method, which prohibits crop diversity and depletes the soil. Most Kolda growers also do not practice composting, a critical and sustainable component to permagardening and bio-intensive farming. Instead, they rely on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which are not only expensive but diminish the overall health of plants and soil. Bio-intensive farming methods, which combine the use of double-digging with adding organic nutrients (such as ash, charcoal, manure, and neem leaves) to the soil, have been proven to increase yields significantly when compared to traditional methods. With heavy rainfall during the rainy season (roughly June to September), much of the nutrient-rich topsoil is lost to erosion. Water is more efficiently captured and directed in the permagardening system. Since permagardening is designed to fit into a 6-meter by 6-meter space (or smaller), it is an ideal method for families of 5-15 people who want to grow a variety of vegetables in their own yards.</p>

<p><a href="?page=sectors/uag/index.html">Urban Agriculture</a> volunteer Maya Lau (2009-2011), along with her counterparts and Associate Peace Corps Director Famara Massaly, facilitated an all-day permagarden training for 31 Senegalese women and men. The individuals targeted for the event included women's group members engaged in farming, agents with the Department of Agriculture, and solo gardeners. </p>

<h3>The Approach </h3>

<p> A small SPA grant (approximately $50) was used to provide breakfast, lunch, ice water, and seedlings to participants. While the focus of trainings should be on information sharing rather than food, the SPA-funded meals in this case aided greatly: it served as an incentive for skeptical trainees to show up to a training on a brand-new technique and also provided them with the energy required for a long day of physical labor, leaving them with a sense of satisfaction. The rest of the training materials were obtained for free: charcoal fines, ash, manure, neem leaves, and gardening tools loaned by trainees.</p>

<p>All trainees took part in the hands-on creation of the permagarden, from the time it was a blank dirt square to a fully planted garden. The facilitators gave explanations of each step of the process, starting first with creating outer walls (berms), digging water catchment holes (swales) in the corners, and then digging the four garden beds in the middle. Several new or seldom-used methods were introduced, such as double-digging, companion planting, and composting.</p>

<p>Despite some squabbling over men's and women's roles in implementing the garden, the facilitators insisted that women also be responsible for digging, rather than relegated to picking neem leaves as some had suggested. Indeed, the women invited to the training were chosen for their farming prowess and routinely do all of their own work without input from men.</p>

<p>After all the proper canals, holes, and walls of the permagarden were created, participants double-dug each of the four garden beds, adding ash, charcoal, manure, and neem leaves into the soil. Finally, the beds were planted with vegetable seedlings. The outer walls were planted with aloe vera and sweet potato vine. Each corner water-saving hole was planted with a papaya tree next to it. The facilitators led a session on composting, showing how kitchen refuse, weeds, and other organic materials can be used in a home composting context. Finally, all participants gathered to discuss what they had learned, what additional questions they had, and many pledged to implement permagardens in their own homes.</p>

<p>Several months later, the permagarden still blooms at the demonstration site. It serves as a permanent display for all visitors to the garden. There are beans, corn, cucumbers, eggplants, peppers, sweet potato, and aloe growing there, some of which are strategically intercropped with one another. The double-digging and soil amendment techniques have clearly paid off, as one can see by comparing the corn grown in the permagarden versus the corn grown nearby, without the benefit of bio-intensive methods. The leaves of the corn plants in the permagarden are hydrated and green, and corn grows abundantly. The other corn plants are lighter green, sometimes dried out, and produce less corn.</p>

<p>Some trainees did go on to create their own permagardens, though only one remains active. Many trainees cited lack of space and different seasonal farming priorities as reasons why they did not implement permagardens. Nevertheless, many trainees remembered certain aspects of the training that they have incorporated into their current practice, such as double-digging. Indeed, it is not critical that trainees replicate the exact design of the permagarden taught in the training. It is more important for trainees to glean important concepts from the training, such as the facts that neem is a natural insecticide, charcoal in soil helps retain water, and composting is a free method of creating fertilizer, so that they can custom-fit these bio-intensive methods to their individual garden settings.</p>

<h3>Next Steps </h3>
<p> The PCV has plans for additional permagarden trainings in preparation for the dry gardening season. These trainings will focus less on creating water canals and more on water saving, composting, and bio-intensive methods, since rainfall and erosion are of less concern in the dry season. Women's groups as well as members of community and hospital gardens have expressed interest in these types of trainings. An important lesson learned from this project is that permagardening, presented as an entire package, will be a hard sell to first-time users. Instead, PCV work should be centered on promoting the various techniques of permagardening, even if this means that locals will not replicate the exact "look" of the permagarden created at the demonstration site. With the continuation of this method, as well as obtaining feedback from Senegalese practitioners, the permagardening technique can be refined and made more accessible to local farmers.</p>
