<h1>Koumpentoum Business Training with Talla</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The Small Enterprise Development (SED) volunteer in Koumpentoum organized a two-day training, led by Peace Corps Trainer Talla Diop, to educate 31 community members on small business practices and how to balance personal and business responsibilities.  The lessons used the "Best Game" simulation, with participants divided into small groups.  The invitees were comprised of local literacy teachers and representatives from women's groups.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/bestgame_1_448.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/bestgame_1_200" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a> Business knowledge in Koumpentoum, as throughout Senegal, is rudimentary compared with the developed world.  Individual vendors in the marketplace have poor or non-existent record-keeping practices, which lead to an inability to analyze or plan business activities; many small vendors barely break even.  Second, it is not common practice to separate business from personal spending, again leading to difficulties in business planning and growth.  Also, many people in Senegal do not use bank accounts, storing their wealth instead in illiquid forms such as buildings or livestock.</p>

<p>There are a series of alphabetization classes held in the department of Koumpentoum, to promote literacy in the local languages of Wolof, Pulaar, and Mandinka.  The curriculum explicitly includes entrepreneurship training, however no specific lesson plans are described and the instructors thus have difficulty in teaching this portion of the curriculum.  By including the instructors in the "Best Game" trainings, they would hopefully be exposed to better ways to teach business concepts to their own classes.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3> 

<p>Community participants in this training were specifically chosen for their potential to pass on what they learned to others and thus increase the indirect impact of the training.  Leading representatives from several women's groups in Koumpentoum were invited in the hopes that they could incorporate the lessons in planning their groups' activities.  Likewise, alphabetization instructors would be able to include business concepts in the practical training component of their curriculum.</p>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/bestgame_2_448.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/bestgame_2_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatright" /></a>The "Best Game" training simulation divides participants into three groups, each of which represents a small manufacturing enterprise.  Members have to decide how much money to allocate each week to raw materials for their business and how much to reserve for personal spending.  Initial funds for each group are provided by a loan which is repaid at the end of the game.  Certain lessons are incorporated into the game, such as the importance of getting receipts for payments made, especially cash payments; the importance of keeping money in a safe place such as a bank to deter theft; and the difficulties that arise in balancing personal and business finances.  On the second day of training, the simulation was repeated with some added complications.  Roles were introduced for certain participants to induce them to behave in ways that would make them examples of good or bad business practices.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>Over the course of two days, 31 participants from the invited groups came, most of them staying for both sessions.  Many participants expressed interest in having Talla return for detailed trainings on accounting, marketing, and business planning.  Additionally, the training was a great opportunity to formally introduce the SED program and the SED volunteer to the community.  Despite initial disappointment at learning that Peace Corps's aim is not to finance small businesses directly, the participants eventually became very involved in the trainings and seemed to enjoy themselves.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/bestgame_3_448.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/bestgame_3_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a>The volunteer plans to follow up with participants individually or in small groups to see how they think the lessons can be applied and what ideas they might have to improve their own business practices.  Already, some of the participants have approached the volunteer about starting new activities with their women's groups, including small-scale food transformation operations.  The volunteer will visit some alphabetization classes to see if their capacity in teaching business concepts has improved.</p>

<p>Based on expressed interest of the participants in this session as well as other members of the community, future training sessions may focus on marketing a new business enterprise, or finding appropriate sources of business funding such as pooled savings or microfinance loans.</p>

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>

<p>Organizing a training with Talla is a great way for SED volunteers to integrate into their communities and quickly identify people who may be interested in working with the volunteer.  One way to improve on the design of the training would be to have participants prepare some of their business ideas beforehand so that that Talla could discuss how to apply to concepts learned in the simulation to real-life situations.</p>
