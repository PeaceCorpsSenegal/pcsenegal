<H1>Jatropha Live Fencing in Kedougou</H1>

<h3>Summary</h3><p>A team of four Peace Corps volunteers direct-seeded over 14,000 Jatropha curcas trees in the village of Diakhaba. The trees were planted around the perimeter of already-protected fields, with the intention of replacing dead-fence posts with living trees. After two to three years, when the fences trees are well-established, a major stress will be lifted from the native forests.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/jatropha_01_700.jpg"><img src="photos/thumbs/jatropha_01_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a> With a dramatically rising population, the demand on Senegal’s natural resources has reached a dangerous level. Deforestation and brush fires have caused the Sahara desert to encroach upon Senegal’s farming land. Senegalese people harvest native trees to build huts and fences, as well as for cooking fuel. The northern half of the country, once filled with lush forests, has received dramatic decreases in rainfall and soil quality.</p>
<p>In southeastern Senegal, the region of Kedougou is so far one of the least-affected zones in the country. But the trans-African highway and international mining activities guarantee Kedougou a similar fate to the rest of the country, if preventative measures are not taken.</p>
<p>PCV Andrew Jondahl worked with farmers in Pondala and other villages northeast of Kedougou from 2007 to 2009, extending agroforestry practices to the local farmers that could generate income, improve soil quality, and protect their fields.</p>
<p>Pondala’s neighboring village, Diakhaba, is relatively young – about 25 years old – but its population has grown quickly and it is now much larger than most villages in the area. An outstanding work ethic shared by many of the farmers in the village has led to the construction of numerous dead-wood fences that protect fields within the village and in the woods – some larger than a hectare. Due to a significant termite population, the wooden fence posts are destroyed within three years and need to be replaced by cutting down more trees.</p>
<p>PCVs had been working with a farmer in the village, Sina Danfakha, for almost four years, so Jondahl approached him about organizing a group of farmers to direct seed Jatropha curcas around the perimeters of their fields to replace the dead-wood fence posts.  Jatropha is termite resistant and so once established, the live fence would not have to be replaced for years, preventing the need to cut down native trees to replace damaged posts. Jatropha is popular among local farmers because it is fast-growing, has an excellent germination rate, and produces seeds that can be used to produce soap or bio-diesel.</p>


<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/jatropha_02_700.jpg"><img src="photos/thumbs/jatropha_02_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" /></a>A meeting was called, using Sina Danfakha as the community organizer, for all farmers interested in installing Jatropha live fences. Jondahl first explained the benefits of a live fence, then the steps to installing and maintaining one, and then the possible costs and set-backs. After the meeting, he and another PCV visited thirty-six fields belonging to twenty-five different farmers and measured their perimeters by pacing them off, estimating one half meter to each step.</p> 
<p>Three weeks later, Jondahl returned to Diakhaba with a team of four PCVs and thirty-five kilograms of locally-purchased Jatropha seed, and aided the farmers in seeding them at the correct spacing, ensuring that the fields were well-weeded before seeding. A primary follow-up visit was performed by Jondahl three weeks later to ensure farmers were weeding their fences to reduce growth competition. Similar visits were performed by other PCVs in the area in the following months.</p>
 

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Twenty-five farmers in Diakhaba, with the help of five Kedougou PCVs, planted over 14,000 Jatropha seeds along the perimeters of existing fences, creating a total of seven kilometers of living fences. As a result, a huge stress will have been lifted from the native forest surrounding Diakhaba, farmers will have a reliable seed source to plant more fences, and they will have a new source of income – market price for the seeds is between 300 and 500 FCFA per kilogram.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>The fences will require maintenance, especially over the new few years, if they are to be effective. This maintenance will include weeding, pruning, and replanting trees that do not survive the hot, dry season. PCVs in the area can extend these techniques to a few farmers in the village, particularly Sina Danfakha, who have already demonstrated a willingness and ability to serve as pilot farmers.  </p>
<p>PCVs can also extend methods for processing the seeds to produce soap and oil. If the level of Jatropha propagation reaches a high level, a possible future capital investment for the village would be a seed press to create bio-diesel.</p>
