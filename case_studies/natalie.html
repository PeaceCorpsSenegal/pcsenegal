<H1>School Gardening in Kaolack</H1>


<h3>Summary</h3><p><a class="gallery" href="photos/nat_10-700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/nat_10-200.jpg" id="floatright" border="0" /></a> A Peace Corps volunteer worked with the village chief and school headmaster to design and implement a garden at the rural community's primary school.  The garden was to be used as a tool to teach students and community members improved gardening and tree propagation techniques and also to improve the <a href="?page=food_security/nutrition.html">nutritional content </a>of school lunches through the addition of vegetables and Moringa oleifera leaves. </p><h3>Context</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/nat_6-700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/nat_6-200.jpg" id="floatleft" border="0" /></a>The Samane Primary School, located in the village of Samane, in the region of <a href="?page=regions/kaolackt/index.html">Kaolack</a>, consists of three buildings and five teachers. The school serves students from Samane as well as  neighboring villages Bane Gory, Bane Soutura, and Sousé.   These communities have a diverse range of languages and cultures, including <a href="?page=language/pulaar/index.html">Pulaar</a>, <a href="?page=language/sereer/index.html">Serer</a>, <a href="?page=language/wolof/index.html">Wolof</a>, and <a href="?page=language/mandinka/index.html">Bambara</a>, but nearly all families are subsistence farmers with very little disposable income.  </p> 

<p>The students sometimes have lunch at the school and sometimes walk home for lunch, but neither meal has many vegetables because they are expensive and unavailable.   PCV Natalie Schmidt (2008-2010) collaborated with the school’s teachers and headmaster and the village chief to create a well and <a href="food_security/gardens.html">school garden</a> that would be a teaching tool and a source of nutrition and income for the students.</p> 

<h3>The Approach </h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/nat_8-700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/nat_8-200.jpg" id="floatleft" border="0" /></a> 
The project began with careful planning. The volunteer and members of the community created a budget for the garden that included fencing and well construction.  A <a href="food_security/index.html"> Food Security Initiative</a> grant, funded by a partnership with <a href="?page=food_security/papa.html">USAID</a>, supported the project in January 2010. The greater community, including family members and students from all benefiting villages, provided the construction labor.  <a class="gallery" href="photos/nat_11-700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/nat_11-200.jpg" id="floatright" border="0" /></a> When the fence and well were constructed, the PCV coached students and teachers to prepare garden beds and a large <a href="?page=sectors/agfo/index.html">tree nursery</a>.  Students took turns watering and weeding in small groups and learned to transplant seedlings at appropriate times and spacing.   The PCV extended <a href="?page=sectors/ag/index.html">pest management</a> techniques using local sources such as neem (Azadirachta indica) to make free, organic insecticide.</p><h3>Results</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/nat_3-700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/nat_3-200.jpg" id="floatleft" border="0" /></a> Students and teachers learned improved gardening techniques as well as proper tree nursery preparation and maintenance.  School leaders were able to incorporate vegetables into students’ lunches and to sell a portion of grown vegetables in order to buy cassava cuttings and more seeds for the garden.   Interest in gardening within the communities has increased dramatically, and many farmers have taken the school’s example and started growing their own vegetables.</p>


<h3>Next Steps </h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/nat_4-700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/nat_4-200.jpg" id="floatright" border="0" /></a> The garden will continue to produce vegetables for school lunches, and Moringa olifera trees planted around the garden’s perimeter will provide nutrition as well as live fencing posts when the wire fence begins to break down.  The school will continue teaching the tree nursery session to its eldest class every year, so each child that goes through the school will receive this agroforestry training.  Income generated from vegetable sales will go toward school supplies and garden improvements such as seeds and tool replacements when necessary. Through the school garden's success, more people will have the capability to establish school and community gardens throughout the area and to provide increased nutrition for all families.</p>
