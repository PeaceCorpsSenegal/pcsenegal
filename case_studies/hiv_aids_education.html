<H1>Targeted HIV/AIDS Education and Testing Activities</H1>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The main goal of this project was to reach targeted populations in Richard Toll most likely to be affected by HIV/AIDS. Activities took place in June 2010 and consisted of eight education and discussion sessions held in the 4 neighborhoods most affected by HIV, one community education session with clandestine sex workers in a nearby village, and a 2-day education and testing event at the local sugar factory.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/hiv_aids_04_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/hiv_aids_04_200.jpg" id="floatleft" border="0" /></a>Although the national HIV/AIDS rate in Senegal remains low in the general population, particularly when compared to other sub-Saharan African countries, among certain populations the rate is estimated to be much higher. The city of Richard Toll, located on the Senegal River in the northern region of Saint Louis, hosts two of Senegal’s high-risk populations, seasonal workers and clandestine sex workers. The local sugar company attracts a diverse population of seasonal workers from across Senegal and from many neighboring countries. With this increase in migrant laborers has come an increase in clandestine sex workers, many of whom come into town from the surrounding villages under the pretext of selling milk or other goods. HIV/AIDS awareness has not kept pace with the recent population changes and conservative estimates for the Dagana prefecture indicate that approximately 90% of the infected population does not know their status. Additionally, women outnumber men in voluntary testing by almost 4 to 1, yet of the men who do get tested 3% test positive compared to 2% of women who get tested. This indicates that there is a large number of men in the area who are HIV positive and unaware of their status.</p>
<p>To address the growing issue of HIV/AIDS in Richard Toll and the surrounding area, PCV Christine Sauvé (2009-2010) worked closely with the social worker at the local health center and staff at the local family planning clinic. After acquiring funding through the Volunteer Activities, Support and Training (VAST) Program, a series of prevention and testing activities were designed for the populations most likely to be affected by HIV/AIDS, including some of the most difficult to reach groups.</p>

<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/hiv_aids_01_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/hiv_aids_01_200.jpg" id="floatright" border="0" /></a>In order to reach residents of the four neighborhoods in Richard Toll most affected by HIV/AIDS, community health educators from the local family planning clinic led two education and discussion sessions in each neighborhood. In each neighborhood one session was held for 25 women aged 25-50 and one session for 25 men aged 25-50.  This age group was chosen because, according to statistics collected by the social worker at the health center, men in this age group are extremely reticent to get tested and thus more education and outreach is necessary for this population, with an emphasis on the importance of testing. Although statistics show that women in this age group are better than their male counterparts at getting tested, they are nonetheless a vulnerable population and their general level of education about HIV/AIDS remains low. To combat these trends, the community health educators presented information on HIV/AIDS prevention methods (abstinence, fidelity, condom use, and testing), modes of transmission, and the importance of treatment. They facilitated lively discussions and also gave participants information on where to go for condoms, testing, medical treatment, and counseling.</p>
<p>An additional education and discussion session was held with unregistered clandestine female sex workers, one of the two local populations identified as a high-risk group. HIV/AIDS education and testing is regularly conducted with registered sex workers, however, unregistered workers are more difficult to access. An experienced nurse from the local health center discreetly invited a group of unregistered sex workers to a community education session held in their home village nearby. In this way the clandestine sex workers were not made to feel that they had been singled out, and the same educational messages were shared with their neighbors. Information was presented on HIV/AIDS prevention methods (including abstinence and fidelity but emphasizing condom use and testing), modes of transmission, and the importance of treatment.   Condoms were distributed and both male and female condom use was demonstrated.  Participants also received information on where they can go for more condoms, testing, medical treatment, and counseling.</p>

This population was specifically identified as a testing priority. Factory workers are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior while away from their families and yet have limited access to education and health services due to long work hours. In order to affect behavior change, information and services were brought directly to the workers. The event was conducted at the health clinic on site at the factory making it easy and convenient for workers to participate. A series of films about HIV/AIDS in West Africa were shown to workers while they waited to be seen for services. After the films, information was presented on HIV/AIDS prevention methods (abstinence, fidelity, condom use, and testing), modes of transmission, and the importance of treatment.  All attendees were encouraged to get tested and discussion sessions also included information on living with HIV and how patients can effectively manage the illness with little impact on normal daily activities. Test results were provided by the end of the day and follow-up counseling was conducted with the social worker. All services were offered free of charge. Additionally, workers’ family members also come to this clinic for medical services and the education session and testing was also conducted in the maternity ward.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>A total of 464 people were reached over the course of the project. A total of 190 inhabitants (96 women and 94 men) participated in the neighborhood education sessions. The village education event reached a total of 55 people (43 women and 12 men), including 12 clandestine sex workers and 3 registered sex workers. At the sugar factory a total of 219 people attended the education session (78 women and 141 men). Of these, 103 people voluntarily tested for HIV (81 men and 22 women). Considering there are usually only 30 voluntary tests per month the event was highly successful and achieved the same number of voluntary tests in two days as would normally occur over a three month period. Additionally, more than three-fourths of those tested were males, the desired testing priority. Often at local testing events the majority of participants are women.</p>

<p>Overall the project was successful in reaching the targeted populations most likely to be affected by HIV/AIDS in Richard Toll. It was also successful in reinforcing health workers’ technical skills in testing and counseling, and allowing health educators to practice and strengthen their skills in conducting HIV/AIDS awareness and education events for the community.</p>


<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/hiv_aids_06_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/hiv_aids_06_200.jpg" id="floatright" border="0" /></a>By raising HIV/AIDS knowledge levels among community residents in general, it is hoped that prevention and treatment efforts in the community will improve over the long term. Specifically, regarding the neighborhood sessions, local health workers hope to remain in contact with participants and begin building a network of educated community leaders who will share information with their neighbors.  It is hoped that participants at the village education session will share information with other sex workers, thereby helping to increase overall prevention efforts. Health center staff would like to build on this experience and do more outreach with clandestine sex workers in other nearby villages. Additionally, they would like to see continued success in reaching men aged 25-50, the demographic most reticent to get tested. In doing so they hope to decrease the stigma attached to testing and start to approach a more accurate count of HIV-positive residents.</p>
