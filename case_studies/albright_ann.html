<h1>Barkedji Field Day</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>PCV Ann Marie Albright held a Field Day in the Pulaar village of Barkedji, 35km West of Linguere, for Middle School and upper grade Primary School students. The day's events focused on gender equality and HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. Seventy students participated, 35 boys and 35 girls. PCVs from the Linguere region facilitated games and encouraged student participation in activities and discussion. </p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/fieldday_1_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/fieldday_1_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a>Gender roles in Senegal are characterized by men supporting their families financially, and women remaining home to cook, clean, and raise children. Girls are expected to attend school and perform well in their studies, but they are also expected to perform their duties at home such as cleaning, sweeping, cooking, laundry, and babysitting. Household chores take away from daylight hours to study, which puts girls at a disadvantage to boys in their classes.While maintaining the household and attending school, girls develop skills that are often taken by granted by boys. These skills include: time maintenance, balance, strength, teamwork, and communication. </p>

<p>HIV/AIDS affects the health of individuals, families, and the entire village. It is important to educate young people regularly about the spread of HIV/AIDS and the subsequent testing and treatment options available in the community. If young people understand the range of the epidemic, then they will hopefully encourage friends and family to practice preventative behavior and get tested regularly.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/fieldday_2_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/fieldday_2_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatright" /></a>The Field Day began with icebreakers such as decorating name tags, playing frisbee, doing the limbo, and dancing name games. Speakers to play music were rented to provide a festive atmosphere for the field games. The group of 70 students was divided by sex, so a boys’ group and a girls’ group would compete for small prizes. PCVs led the students in 4 field games developed to illustrate the difficulty and skill involved in women’s work.</p>

<p>The first field game was an egg race. The 2 groups were each given a metal spoon and an egg. The each member of the groups raced to the end of compound and back while balancing the egg on the spoon. This activity was designed to illustrate the skills of balance and patience. The second field game was a 3 legged race. The groups paired off and tied their legs together with cloth, and then each pair raced to the end of the compound and back. This activity was designed to illustrate teamwork. The third field game was designed by PCV Albright. It turned the female task of getting water into a competitive game. One by one, members of the 2 groups carried a plastic laundry tub full of water on their heads to the end of the compound and attempted to spill as much water as possible into a small bucket on the ground without removing the tub from their heads. The boys’ bucket and girls’ bucket were compared to see which one had the most water. This activity was designed to illustrate balance and strength. The final field game was the human knot. The students were divided into groups of 10. A group of 10 would circle up and each person would join hands with 2 others in the group. Then the group would try to disentangle their hands without breaking their grip. This activity was designed to illustrate communication.</p>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/fieldday_3_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/fieldday_3_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a>After the field games, the focus of the event switched to HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment.The students gathered in the community center to watch a projection of Scenarios in Africa. While watching the film, students were served bissap and beignets by PCVs. At the film's conclusion, PCV Emily Naftalin lead a true or false discussion debunking common myths about HIV/AIDS. Correct responses were rewarded with small prizes. Health Post workers then lead a question and answer based HIV/AIDS causerie.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>Students enjoyed the field games, and the boys were impressed with the performance of the girls. The girls won ¾ of the field games.  Seventy students were invited to participate in the games, but the number of those who attended to watch the games, projection, and listen to the discussion far surpassed those invited. The Health Post workers believed the message was successfully conveyed. Further, students have asked when the event will be repeated.</p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>

<p>The girls did not initially want to participate in the field games, and they needed encouragement from PCVs to engage in the competition against the boys. Another complication was the discussion with the Health Post workers. A crowd of bystanders gathered in the Community Center compound, and the students began coming and going throughout the discussion. </p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>PCV Albright will to continue to host movie nights which promote gender equality and HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. The movie nights will target middle school students.</p>
