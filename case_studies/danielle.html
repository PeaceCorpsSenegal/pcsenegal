<H1>Seed Storage Facility in Kayemor</H1>

<h3>Summary</h3><p>Two Peace Corps Volunteers have worked with their community to construct a seed storage facility that will enable farmers to safely and securely save their seed from year to year, allowing them to have more flexibility in when they want to sell their seed or consume it and allowing them save seed to plant the next year.  This facility will also enable more rapid expansion of a current improved seed extension program in the community.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>

The importance of being able to safely and securely store seeds cannot be over-stated.  Safe and secure seed storage provides farmers with the option to store their seed immediately after harvest and wait to sell it until the price rises again (since the price of almost every field crop drops significantly at the end of the rainy season when all the farmers are selling their harvest).  It also means farmers can be sure their seed will be available to eat later in the year (ex. during the next rainy season) when they often have little money to buy food.  Finally, it saves farmers from having to buy new seed to plant every year because they are able to save some seed from their current harvest to plant the following year.  </p>
<p>The people of the Communauté Rurale de Kayemor, which is located in the department of Nioro du Rip and Kaolack region and serves a total population of over 18,000 residents in 23 Wolof and Pulaar villages, have recognized the importance of a secure seed storage facility for many years, but were unable to finance the construction of such a large building by themselves.  When Kate Ballentine (2007-2009), the first PCV in Kayemor, learned about this situation, she wrote a Peace Corps Partnership application to raise funds for the construction of a seed storage facility that would provide just the safe and secure place to store seeds that these villagers have wanted for years.  When Kate’s service ended, the new PCV in Kayemor, Danielle Stoermer (2009-2011), took over raising funds for the facility.  It took 2 years to raise all the money needed to finance the facility, but when it was all raised (in January 2010) construction commenced soon afterward.  The people of the Communauté Rurale de Kayemor agreed to provide 25% of the total funds necessary for the facility: 10% in cash and 15% in kind (ex. building materials, labor, etc.).  Construction is progressing very quickly and will be done before the rainy season starts in June.</p>

<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/danielle_02_448.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/danielle_02_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright"/></a>Once the seed storage facility is complete, any farmer in the Communauté Rural de Kayemor will be able to store seed in it.  There will be large barrels inside the building where the seed can be safely stored so mice and other animals cannot eat it; the seed can also be treated with chemicals, when necessary, to keep bugs from eating it.  Crops with large seeds, such as corn, rice, cowpeas, millet, sorghum, and peanuts, will be given priority since they are harder for farmers to store in their own homes.</p>
<p>Danielle, like other agricultural PCVs, is working with an agricultural research institute in Senegal (ISRA) to extend improved varieties of seed to farmers throughout Senegal.  In this program, the PCV gives, for example, 2 kilos of improved seed to a farmer at the beginning of the rainy season and, when the farmer has harvested the crop, he/she will give the PCV 4 kilos of seed so that the PCV will be able to give twice as many farmers improved seed the next year.  Kate extended improved varieties of cowpea, rice, sorghum, and corn to farmers in the Communauté Rurale de Kayemor during her two years of service.  While most of the farmers have achieved higher yields with these improved varieties than with traditional varieties, they have not been able to reap the full benefits of their increased yields without a secure seed storage facility.  Danielle is continuing this improved seed extension program for the 2010 rainy season and will give improved seed to about 125 farmers, all of whom will be able to store their seed in the seed storage facility in Kayemor and, thereby, take full advantage of the benefits of these improved seed varieties.  Because of the availability of the seed storage facility, Danielle will work with a handful of highly experienced farmers to help them become local seed sources for these improved varieties, thereby allowing the program to expand to more farmers at an even faster rate.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/danielle_03_448.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/danielle_03_225.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft"/></a>The main results of this facility are yet to be seen but, if the excitement and energy it is creating in the Communauté Rurale de Kayemor is any indication of its success, this facility will greatly improve their livelihoods.</p>
<p>Not only will this facility create material improvements for this community, it will also act as an educational tool as well as a confidence- and capacity-builder because the farmers will learn how to properly select and store their seed and how to grow and store new crops.  In addition, the individuals in the community who will be in charge of operating the facility will learn certain skills, such as record-keeping, contract making, payment practices, how to determine when seed is no longer viable, and how to obtain seed from local sources.  </p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/danielle_05_448.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/danielle_05_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" /></a>Once the seed storage facility is complete, the focus will be on teaching the individuals in charge of operating the facility the skills they will need to know to effectively and efficiently run the facility, , such as record-keeping, contract making, payment practices, how to determine when seed is no longer viable, and how to obtain seed from local sources.  These individuals will then be responsible for teaching farmers practices important for maximizing this new seed storage facility, such as how to select between seed for consumption, sale, and planting during the next rainy season, how to properly store seed for these different uses, how best to ration food consumption, and when to sell excess grain for maximum profit.</p>
<p>In an effort to facilitate replication of such a seed storage facility, Danielle will work with community members to write a report regarding the facility, which will be shared with the Senegalese government, PCVs, and NGOs in Senegal.</p>
