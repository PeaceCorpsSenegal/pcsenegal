<h1>Biogas Digester </h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>As a side project I experimented with small scale biogas digesters, one cubic meter (1000 L) or less in size. I built two 600 L digesters, one at the Kedougou PC house and another at a farm near Thies as well as a larger 1000 L digester at the Simenti Hotel in the Niokolo Koba National Park.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/biogas_1_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/biogas_1_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a>“Properly designed and used, a biogas digester mitigates a wide spectrum of environmental undesirables: it improves sanitation; it reduces greenhouse gas emissions; it reduces demand for wood and charcoal for cooking, and therefore helps preserve forested areas and natural vegetation; and it provides a high-quality organic fertilizer. A well-maintained digester can last over 20 years and will pay for itself in one-fifth that time. But for the developing world, biogas’s greatest benefit may be that it can help alleviate a very serious health problem: poor indoor air quality.</p>
<p>Some 2 billion people around the world, including 89% of the sub-Saharan African population, use biomass for cooking and heating, according to Energy for Development: The Potential Role of Renewable Energy in Meeting the Millennium Development Goals, a report stemming from a 2004 conference of the same name organized by the Dutch government. Where combustible biomass is the chief energy source, life often revolves around an indoor cookstove or open fire that likely has no vent to the outdoors. Just gathering the fuel takes several hours a day—work that, in sub- Saharan Africa, is done almost entirely by women and children, according to Energy for Development. Since women also do most of the housework, including cooking, they and their children are exposed to cookstove smoke far more than men.</p> 
<p>Their respiratory health suffers accordingly. In 2000, burning solid fuels caused 1–2 million deaths, comprising 3–4% of total global mortality, according to Renewables 2005. Indoor air pollution such as that stemming from biomass burning may increase the risk of acute lower respiratory infections in children, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults, tuberculosis, low birth weight, asthma, ear infections, and even cataracts, according to the 2002 WHO report Addressing the Links between Indoor Air Pollution, Household Energy and Human Health. The Global Health Council, an international group of health care professionals and organizations based in Washington, DC, states that of all infectious diseases worldwide, those in the lower respiratory tract are the leading cause of death.</p>
<p>A biogas digester consists of one or more airtight reservoirs into which a suitable feedstock—cow dung, human waste, abattoir waste—is placed, either in batches or by continuous feed. Small-scale digesters for household use are commonly made of concrete, bricks, metal, fiberglass, or plastic. Larger commercial biogas digesters are made mainly of bricks, mortar, and steel.</p>
<p>Digestion is accomplished in two general stages. First, acidogenic bacteria turn biomass into volatile fatty acids and acetic acid. Then methanogenic bacteria metabolize these compounds into a combination of methane-rich gas and an odorless phosphorus- and nitrogen-laden slurry, which makes excellent fertilizer. Depending on temperature and moisture content, it takes about 6–25 days to fully process a batch, according to a fact sheet from WASTE, a development NGO based in the Netherlands. Simpler digesters may take longer.</p>
<p>The end product is about 60–70% methane and 20–30% CO2, with small amounts of hydrogen sulfide and other impurities. The gas can be connected to a household stove for cooking, to a light fixture with a gauze mantle for lighting, or to other appliances with simple natural gas plumbing; it burns like liquefied petroleum gas. Depending on the design and size, prices for small-scale biodigesters run from US$100 to US$1,700.</p> 
<p>It takes 1–2 cows, 5–8 pigs, or 4 adult humans to supply adequate daily feedstock for a single-household biodigester, according to a UNDP– Global Environment Facility fact sheet. The daily input of dung and urine from a single cow produces 1–2 kilowatt- hours of electricity or 8–9 kilowatthours of heat. Over a year, this is just about enough to run a refrigerator. In most African applications, a household biogas installation provides sufficient energy for cooking and some lighting.”</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/biogas_2_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/biogas_2_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatright" /></a>Many biogas digesters in West Africa are plagued by a common set of problems. Some are too small to be useful, with less than 0.5 cubic meters of capacity. Many are too expensive for the size of the digester and the amount of gas produced. Others are just poorly constructed and leak gas. Having observed the efforts of other NGOs in West Africa I was convinced that there must be a better way to build small scale digesters in the 0.5 to 1 cubic meter range. Based off of my observations I also concluded that it was difficult to produce a cost effective digester that is between one and three cubic meters in size.</p>
<p>Fortunately I came across Echo’s Incline Digester design which seemed to be a good cross between size, 0.6 cubic meters, and cost. Mostly out of my own curiosity, I set out to replicate the design to test how well it worked. I replicated the design nearly entirely but chose to use a floating drum unit full of water as a gas collection chamber rather than a large plastic bag due to the lack of durability. </p>
<p>The digester was loaded with a fresh manure and water mixture and fed 15% of it’s volume once a week in order to maintain a 50 day retention time.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/biogas_3_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/biogas_3_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a>The first digester turned out well and produced gas as expected. Without proper measuring equipment I was not able to ascertain exactly how much gas was being produced. However a rough measure of how quickly the gas being produced displaced a liter of water led me to believe that it was producing 400-600 L of gas a day. The single storage tank had a capacity of 100 L and lasted for 45 minutes with the biogas stove on high.</p>
<p>The second digester was built out of a 1 cubic meter plastic reservoir and had two 100 L floating drum gas tanks. This digester was installed at the Simenti Hotel in the Niokolo Koba National Park with support from the German research group DPZ. The digester will run off of the kitchen scraps from the hotel and provide cooking gas to the park guards. In addition to all of the environmental and health benefits that biogas digesters provide, putting kitchen scraps in the digester keeps the monkeys and baboons from getting into them, a major nuisance and health hazard.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>At this moment there are no next steps planned. My efforts with biogas had more to do with my personal interest than a work priority and therefore it never became a fully developed program. However, others could easily replicate the work.</p>

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/biogas_4_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/biogas_4_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatright" /></a>Under the idea scenario the gas storage unit could hold half of the volume of gas that the digester can produce in a day. Any less than a third and gas will be lost between meals. A rough rule of thumb is that a digester can produce a quantity of gas over 24 hours equal to the volume of the digester.</p>
<p>The ECHO design used metal oil drums for the digester. However, due to the sulfur content biogas corrodes metal. At a year and a half the original digester is still holding a seal, however it will not last forever. While it costs a little more, it is my opinion that using a plastic reservoir is a better idea in the long run.</p>
<p>One of the issues with both models of digester that I built was the small opening. Using the existing inlets and outlets on the barrels and reservoirs meant that I was limited to 63mm piping. This made it difficult to get larger chucks of organic material into the digester. The inlets would often clog, slowing down the process of loading the digester. </p>
<p>One possible way the design could be improved would be the addition of an agitator. Mixing the slurry increases gas production and reduced the chance of thick scum forming on the top. However I was not able to figure out an economical and durable way to include an agitator.</p>
<p>The most important lesson I learned was the time it takes to collect manure or other organic matter is a big determinate of the usability of a biogas digester. In my opinion digesters should be placed within 300 meters of a consistent supply of organic waste, ie a cattle pen, latrine, or kitchen. Walking around a village to collect manure is too time consuming to be worthwhile. The ideal situation would be one where the organic material could be sluiced directly into the digester.</p>
