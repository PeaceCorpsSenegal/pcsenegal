<h1>Fass Toucouleur Reading Room</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/readingroom_1_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/readingroom_1_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatright" /></a>PCV Jennifer Richards set up a reading room in her village in the winter of 2010. She noticed that the children in her village lacked both the space to be studious and creative, as well as materials for those pursuits. Setting the room took several months and involved the cooperation and assistance of many people and several organizations. Today the reading room is open daily for kids to utilize and contains several hundred books in both French and English. Additionally the space is also used for art classes, language tutoring and other activities for kids ages two through seventeen.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Fass Toucouleur is a Pulaar village located twenty kilometers south of Kaolack. It is five kilometers from the nearest main road and does not have electricity. It does have a school, which about 75 children in the village attend. Jennifer started a coloring club and helped her host siblings and other village kids with school work from early on in her service. This was done in her hut or in the family compound, under the shade of a tree. It did not take long for the number of children turning up to study and do art exceeded the space and resources she had available. Another PCV suggested the idea of setting up a reading room. Jennifer talked with the Chief, her counterparts and numerous parents in the village to see if there was an interest in such a project. The support was overwhelming and unanimous. </p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/readingroom_2_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/readingroom_2_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a>The Chief offered a hut in his compound that could be converted into a reading room space and men in the village agreed to donate the labor needed to remodel it.  Jennifer worked with a local NGO that donated furniture, books, and money to help with the remodeling. A tin roof was fitted to the room, in the interest of keeping out rain.  Additional funds were needed for the roofing materials and basic supplies. These were made possible through a small RPCV grant. This process took a few months, at the end of which the room had a fresh coat of paint, educational posters, desks, chalkboard, and a large bookshelf holding a decent amount of books, puzzles, games, and coloring / art supplies. The NGO, Doctors for Orphans, has been sending shipments of French books for all age groups every couple months and has been a huge help to the project. Solar lanterns were also donated; allowing the kids to study and use the space in the evenings. On an average day 25 to 40 kids make use of the room, some staying long enough to read  a book or browse a magazine between school and chores, and  others spending an hour or two perusing numerous books, working on puzzles, coloring and so forth. </p>
<p>Some of the most popular types of books are the picture books and dictionaries for very young children, as well as all the French books for kids ages six through eleven. The books and magazines with animal and geographic photos and information are hugely popular as well; the Zoo Books and National Geographics in particular. There are several French activity books/magazine periodicals geared towards various youth age groups that are also highly enjoyed. The absolute favorite book at group story times remains Everybody Poops, which many of the kids can tell themselves in Pulaar.  The other favorite has to be Tikki Tikki Tembo, the classic tale of a boy with a long name who fell in a well.</p>

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/readingroom_3_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/readingroom_3_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatright" /></a>One of the biggest challenges with the reading room is maintaining cleanliness and order. Older kids take turns with daily sweepings, re-shelving, and organizing of the books. Kids who have never had access to a library understandably do not have a sense of how to keep it tidy. The young children especially like to make a mess of things, and the daily dust that gets blown in is quite a large amount.  Jennifer has tried to find a balance between helping organize the reading room and teaching the kids how to care for it themselves. The older youth are getting quite adept at keeping it sorted and teaching and reminding the wee ones to take care with the materials.</p>
<p>Having structured classes can be challenging as well, as it is hard to set times for events with children. The reading room is a space of about four meters by four meters, and thus can only accommodate a dozen or so kids comfortably at any given time. A larger room would be more ideal, and hopefully down the road that can be a reality.</p>
<p>Even if untidy at times and a bit small, the reading room is a wonderful space for the children to learn, be creative, and explore new ideas.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>It is hoped that the reading room will continue to thrive and that eventually can be expanded to a larger space.  In addition it is hoped that the next PCV will be able to be involved even less so with the running of the room, in the interest of supporting long term sustainability for the project. The next PCV will, however, continue to facilitate the donation of books and art materials and provide counsel to the Chief and village youth working with the room as needed. </p>
<p>Libraries and reading rooms can be fairly easy and affordable to set up. It is hoped that the Fass Toucouleur reading room will inspire others, and the expansion of the basic concept into larger spaces and potentially community center / resource spaces.</p>
