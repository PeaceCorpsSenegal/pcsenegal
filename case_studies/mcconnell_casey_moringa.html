<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The following is a case study reviewing a joint Peace Corps (PC) / Counterpart International (CPI) Senegal project involving the planting of intensive <em>Moringa oliefera</em> beds in the region of Matam, Senegal.  Citing the region-wide problems of child malnutrition, rapidly declining tree populations (particularly the species <em>Moringa</em>), and the need to re-familiarize and sensitize communities as to the numerous benefits of <em>Moringa</em>, PC volunteer Bernard Wiseman proposed that CPI and PC work as partners to perform a large scale "<em>Moringa</em> Tournée." Serigne Mbacke Loum, the Project Manager for CPI’s office in the Matam region, agreed with Wiseman’s primary project goal of using <em>Moringa</em> to prevent and reduce child malnutrition, and proposed that the project be implemented in communities in which CPI currently carries out their Food for Education Program.  Loum saw clearly how the exceptional benefits of <em>Moringa</em> cultivation could compliment and enhance CPI’s Food for Education Program’s current activities (which include school gardens, nutritional education, and a school lunch program).  Over a seven day period from August 16th- 22nd 2010, the project was successfully implemented at 38 of a proposed 48 sites.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Upon Wiseman’s close of service, PCV Michael Shannon of Ourossogui, PCV Casey McConnell of Richard Toll and Monsieur Loum of CPI began considering specifics on how to best extend <em>Moringa</em> to a large number of communities while considering available resources, constraints, and the primary project goal of preventing and reducing child malnutrition.  It was agreed that intensive <em>Moringa</em> cultivation, a technique that maximizes leaf yield by planting many trees in deeply cultivated, nutrient amended garden beds, would be the most appropriate and beneficial method of extension.  It was agreed that this technique would provide the high leaf yield required to eventually, upon harvest, demonstrate how both fresh and dried <em>Moringa</em> leaves can be added to local dishes to prevent and reduce child malnutrition.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Monsieur Loum, CPI took on the responsibility of identifying interested communities that already participate in The Food for Education Program, and of managing all communication to those communities on behalf of the project.  Shannon worked on behalf of PC to guarantee good communication between all parties, and to assure both organizations made best use of their particular strengths and resources in regard to the project. McConnell took responsibility for planning the technical agricultural aspects, recognizing the required community resources needed for success, and communicating them to CPI.</p>
<p>Over a four month period, Loum and his CPI facilitators made site visits to ensure that each community had in place the required resources of land, protection from animals and livestock, a reliable water source, the motivation to learn and adopt a new agricultural technique, and the manpower to perform the required long term maintenance.  CPI communicated to community leaders these requirements and tried to convey the goals and benefits of the project, namely the <em>Moringa</em> leaf’s potential as a nutritional supplement and its immense value in combating child malnutrition.  The 48 targeted communities ranged from small villages to large towns, and were ethnically Pulaar, with the exceptions of one Wolof village and one Sarakhoulé village.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>Hands-on trainings in the preparation and seeding of two 6m x 1m intensive <em>Moringa</em> beds at each of 48 chosen communities constituted the project’s major activity. In addition, at least two <em>Moringa</em> trees would be planted for future seed production at each community.  These trainings would be PCV-led, and would be attended by community leaders, health care workers, school teachers, the proposed gardener or caretaker, as well as any interested men, women and children of the general community.  The improved, bio-intensive farming technique known as "double digging" would be extended.  In preparation for this endeavor, each community was asked to measure two 6m x 1m plots, then to cultivate those plots to a depth of 20-30cm.  In addition, each community was asked to procure, in advance, the following materials to be utilized as soil amendments (as prescribed by the bio-intensive, "double digging" technique): two full rice sacs of green materials (preferably Neem leaves), three full rice sacs of manure (preferably cow manure), one-half rice sac of wood ash, and one-half rice sac of bio-char. CPI facilitators traveled to each community during the weeks leading up to the project, both to evaluate site suitability and communicate the necessary preparations as stated.</p>
<p>McConnell, Shannon, and Loum shared responsibility for ensuring the logistical support needed for the project’s success. Peace Corps would contribute the labor of eight PCVs experienced in Intensive <em>Moringa</em> Cultivation, Moustapha Ndiaye (a PC Urban Agriculture Counterpart and native of Matam), PC Volunteer Support Assistant Tidiane Diao, over 40,000 viable <em>Moringa</em> seeds, and two PC vehicles.  CPI would contribute the assistance of six facilitators familiar with the targeted communities, one vehicle, and a much appreciated per diem to cover the cost of food for the eight PC volunteers.  The PC volunteers /staff and CPI facilitators would be broken up into four teams.  Each team would conduct two intensive <em>Moringa</em> cultivation trainings per day at two communities as geographically convenient to each other as possible.  To account for unseen variables and difficulties, it was agreed that both parties commit to the project a time commitment of eight days.</p>
	
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>On August 16th, CPI and PC began implementation of the above described project plan, attempting 43 of the originally proposed 48 communities.  Loum made the decision to abandon five communities just prior to the start date because they could not meet project requirements.  The project plan was implemented at 38 of the attempted 43 communities, a success rate of 88%.  Of the five abandoned communities, one was left because of inaccessibility due to bad weather, one due to insufficient fencing, one because of non-working a water source, and two because they were completely unprepared and/or non-present upon arrival.</p>
<p>In order to measure success and provide information for follow up, each team was charged with recording data describing community participation, preparedness, motivation, and overall comprehension of the training’s content. This data was both quantitative and qualitative.  The project involved the participation of 188 men, 111 women, 170 boys (17 yrs. and under), and 91 girls (17 yrs. and under).  The trainings were conducted at a variety of locations based upon the resources of each individual community; these sites included elementary and middle schools, health posts, compounds of community leaders, water sources.  Upon their arrival to the proposed implementation site, each team assessed whether or not the existing fencing was sufficient, as well as presence of a reliable water source.  In four instances, upon realizing that one or both of these resources were insufficient, teams worked with the host community to relocate the training to a more suitable compound.</p>
<p>In general, community preparedness, attendance, and motivation were good to excellent.  Only one site out of 38 was described as "unprepared," meaning they had not procured the needed materials prior to the team’s arrival.  Only five of 38 were noted for poor attendance and motivation, meaning that they were either not participating in the physical labor, or only had one to two community members in attendance.  The qualitative data recorded by each team was also generally positive.  Team members often reported that training participants showed good to excellent comprehension of the bio-intensive, "double digging" technique.  Teams commonly reported that after demonstrating the technique through about two repetitions, the training participants from the host community would take over all labor, while team members would simply monitor.  Team members put a special emphasis on instructing one to two individuals, then challenging them to instruct their peers in attendance.</p>
<p>In the end, 47.5 beds were prepared and seeded.  This fell short of the original goal to prepare and seed two beds per community.  Mid-morning on the first day of the tournée, it was agreed that the training plan be adjusted; each team would prepare and seed only one bed per community.  This ensured that the trainings would not be rushed, and that the proper attention to detail was paid during instruction of the bio-intensive, "double digging" technique. Only at ten communities were more than one bed prepared and seeded.  However, every community which hosted a training thoroughly prepared and seeded at least one bed, and planted at minimum two individual <em>Moringa</em> trees somewhere inside or nearby the training site for a future seed supply.  For the purpose of adaptive research, each team planted one-half of each bed at 10 cm spacing and one-half at 20 cm spacing.  During the second phase of the project, PCV’s will record data to measure which spacing provides a better overall yield considering soil type.</p>
<p>This project was very low-input, aside from transportation costs.  Transport included two PC vehicles and one CPI vehicle.  The community contribution did not include monetary expenses.  Communities were selected because they met certain criteria beforehand: to have secure fencing, a year-round reliable water source, a caretaker or gardener for future maintenance, and at least some tools.  The organic materials they were asked to provide as bed amendments are all locally available at no cost.  PC Kaolack Region provided over 40,000 viable <em>Moringa</em> seeds, which were collected at no cost.</p>


<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>In November of 2010, approximately two and a half months after the tournée above-described, a team of eight PCVs and CPI facilitators will implement the project’s next phase.  The next phase of the project consists of conducting trainings on how to harvest and utilize <em>Moringa</em> leaves to prepare a highly nutritious powder to be added to traditional Senegalese dishes.  An emphasis will be placed on communicating the powder’s benefits to pregnant women, mothers who are nursing, and children under five.  In addition, PCVs will conduct hands-on demonstrations to illustrate how to make the <em>Moringa</em> powder.  The November tournée will also ask each team to record follow up information to measure the first tournée’s success and help measure its community impact and sustainability.  In addition, as previously stated, PCVs will record which tree spacing produces the higher yield.</p>

<h1><em>Moringa oleifera</em> Cultivation Project - Phase II</h1>
<div style="-webkit-column-count:2;">
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Peace Corps (PC) and Counterpart International (CPI) re-collaborated to perform the second phase of their <em>Moringa oleifera</em> extension project in the region of Matam, Senegal.  Teams successfully re-visited 36 of the 38 communities that comprised the first campaign in August 2010.  Each of these visits included hands-on trainings on the harvest and care of the intensive <em>Moringa</em> beds planted in August 2010, <em>Moringa</em> propagation through cuttings, and the transformation of fresh <em>Moringa</em> leaves into powder.  Each visit also included an educational talk explaining the tremendous nutritional benefits of <em>Moringa</em> powder, specifically its potential value in the prevention and reduction of child malnutrition.  For the purpose of adaptive research, leaf samples were taken from each bed (10 and 20 cm spacing).  Community members were also advised on proper utilization, dosage, storage, etc of <em>Moringa</em> powder.  As a final point, the importance of expansion was strongly emphasized; community members were encouraged to replicate the intensive bed technique and to plant more individual trees in their communities.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>PCVs and CPI facilitators divided into three teams, using the previous campaign as a model.  Each team consisted of two PCVs and one CPI facilitator; Peace Corps Volunteer Support Assistant Tidiane Diao rotated between teams from day to day.</p>
<p>Planning began immediately following the August campaign, and was led by CPI’s Serigne Loum and Dado Faye, and Peace Corps’ Tidiane Diao and Casey McConnell.  The first week of November 2010 was chosen for two primary reasons: the intensive beds would be mature enough for harvest, at approximately ten weeks after planting, and to avoid conflict with community preparations for the Muslim holiday of Tabaski.  PCV McConnell went twice to CPI’s Ourossogui office to meet with Monsieur Loum and create a rough day-to-day schedule and to schedule a realistic span of days needed to for transport to all communities.  Once again, CPI facilitators took responsibility for communicating dates, training content, target audience, etc. to each community.  A special emphasis was made to invite pregnant women and nursing mothers.  Communities were advised not to harvest, prune, or transplant any of the <em>Moringa</em> trees prior to the return of CPI and PC in November.</p>
<p>This phase of the project combined both agricultural and nutritional trainings, as well as collection of follow-up data for the purpose of simple adaptive research.  Upon arrival to each community, each team went first to the garden site.  There, they determined whether or not the community had planted a second or third bed as instructed, and made observations to determine the overall health of the trees and condition of the beds.  Teams also tried to distinguish aesthetic differences between beds planted at 10 cm or 20 cm spacing, noting color of leaves, fullness/density, and average height.</p>
<p>Next, teams explained to the training audience PC Senegal’s plan to use this project to conduct adaptive research.  A total of ten trees were harvested at each site: five from a 10 cm spaced bed and five from a 20 cm spaced bed, chosen as randomly as possible.  Simultaneously, community participants were instructed on how to harvest an intensive bed and invited to participate, thus beginning the training.  Teams cut the trees to a 20 cm height, removed and saved the leaves for measurement at a later date, then used the trunks to demonstrate <em>Moringa</em> cultivation through cuttings.  Participants were advised that upon harvest, the strongest, thickest, non-green cuttings could be transplanted to another location in the community.  While at the garden site, teams also advised participants on proper maintenance; participants were instructed that beds could be harvested every 8 to 10 weeks and advised to water regularly.  In addition, teams explained the importance of adding large amounts of manure to the soil after each harvest, emphasizing that without these interventions and care, <em>Moringa</em> will struggle to produce leaf yields during the hot season.  In addition, PCVs taught the "manure tea" technique as a viable alternative to often expensive or inaccessible chemical fertilizers; not only for use with Moringa, but all crops.</p>
<p>The next segment of the training took place in a cooler, shady location.  Here, participants were taught in detail how to transform freshly harvested <em>Moringa</em> leaves into highly nutritious <em>Moringa</em> powder.  To make demonstration possible, each team brought an abundance of previously dried <em>Moringa</em> leaves.  CPI supplied a large bucket and a sifter. Communities provided a traditional mortar and pestle.  Participants were advised to first wash the leaves, and then spread them on a large cloth in the shade to dry for two to three days. The avoidance of direct sunlight during drying was strongly emphasized, as it destroys vitamin A content.  Teams then demonstrated the process of pounding and sifting the leaves.  The population’s familiarity with this form of food transformation made it quick and easy to teach.</p>
<p>After pounding and sifting a few handfuls of leaves, teams used a spoon to explain dosage amounts.  One heaping soup spoon is roughly equivalent to eight grams of refined powder.  Communities were recommended to use <em>Moringa</em> powder to supplement the school lunches provided by CPI’s Food for Education Program through adding two to three heaping spoonfuls per bowl.  It was emphasized that the powder is not to be cooked or exposed to high temperatures, lest the nutritional value be diminished.  It was also made clear that the powder can be added to any dish; the audience was invited to taste the powder to assure them through experience that its taste is not overly bitter or strong, and does not drastically change the taste of drinks or dishes to which it is added.  Using local language as much as possible, teams explained how the vitamins and minerals in <em>Moringa</em> powder can prevent illness, foster growth, etc.  Special attention was paid to the mention of the powder’s potential to prevent and reduce anemia in pregnant and lactating women, and to prevent vitamin A deficiency in children.</p>
<p>The need to plant more intensive <em>Moringa</em> beds and individual trees was repeatedly stressed at each of the trainings, especially in closing.  Participants were encouraged to locate a nearby <em>Moringa</em> tree and educated on when to harvest pods and store seeds.  Participants were given the confidence that they could now be <em>Moringa</em> extension agents within their communities.</p>
	 
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Over the span of five days, teams visited 36 communities.  Trainings were completed successfully at 32 of those communities, meaning that all subject matter was covered and all techniques demonstrated with solid community participation and preparedness.  Moreover, 32 of 38 communities (85%) completed both phase one (August 2010) and phase two (November 2010) of the project.</p>
<p>At each training, teams recorded qualitative and quantitative data to measure community participation, preparedness, motivation, and overall comprehension of subject matter.  In total the November trainings involved the participation of 243 men, 329 women, 170 boys (17 yrs. and under), and 246 girls (17yrs. and under).  These numbers included 23 teachers, and 23 of the 32 training sites were schools.  There was a notable increase in participation when compared to the August campaign, with total participation nearly doubling from 560 to 1,041 people.  Women and girls participation saw the most drastic increase, at around 70%.</p>
<p>Perhaps the clearest indicator of project success came in the simple observation of whether or not the communities had expanded since the August campaign as instructed.  Of the total 36 communities visited, 26 had planted at least one additional intensive bed between August and November; 10 showed no expansion.  Teams also described communities in terms of their participation, preparedness, and motivation. These descriptions were also based on observations regarding the overall health of the trees and condition of the beds.  Of the 32 communities in which the trainings were completed, 10 were described as "excellent"; 10 as "good"; 9 as "adequate", and 3 as "poor".</p>
<p>Teams were able to take leaf samples from 32 communities to conduct simple exercise in adaptive research.  The samples were divided, dried, and weighed.  Dry leaf matter from beds spaced at 20 cm more productive (1,240 grams), than those spaced at 10 cm (910 grams).  Moreover, visual observations indicated that the trees in beds spaced at 20 cm generally had a greater density of leaf matter and were greener in color, however were not necessarily of greater height.</p>
 
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>This project has the potential to continue to impact the health habits and agricultural knowledge of participating communities in important ways.  Communities now have capable local extension agents and physical examples of intensive <em>Moringa</em> cultivation.  Participants can also now apply elements of the bio-intensive "double-digging" technique to improve the soil fertility and management of their existing gardens and fields.  The project built upon pre-existing accepted wisdom concerning <em>Moringa</em> and its health benefits.  Participants were educated on the specific nutritional benefits and trained in the transformation of <em>Moringa</em> leaves.  They were strongly encouraged to utilize this knowledge to improve the health of not only their children, pregnant and nursing mothers, but also the community as a whole.</p>
<p>The challenges to this project’s sustainability are simple.  Will caretakers take care of the trees that were planted?  Will they continue to water sufficiently and add manure to ensure leaf production?  A future project, before or during the 2011 rainy season, would answer these questions, reinforce technical knowledge, encourage expansion and increase the likelihood of overall sustainability.  A second project involving only 10 to 15 communities which showed themselves accountable, organized, and committed from the August to November campaigns is certainly warranted.  Furthermore, Counterpart International has proven an excellent work partner, and has expressed interest in both building on the Matam region campaign and replicating the project elsewhere in Senegal.</p>
