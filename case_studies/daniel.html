<H1>Youth Entrepreneur Workshop in Fatick</H1>

<h3>Summary</h3><p>From December 8th to December 11th PCV Daniel Robles led a Youth Entrepreneurship Workshop in Fatick, Senegal. The workshop's goals were to introduce young men and women (between the ages of 17-23) to the basic principles of business, how to start a business, and resources available in the city. The first two days were composed of an intensive course on finding a business idea and resource mapping. The class was taught in Wolof by the volunteer with assistance from his counterpart, Birame Ndao. The third day was an intensive and abbreviated business skills lesson in Accounting, Marketing, Costing, and Financial Planning. The final day there was a panel of banks and micro-finance institutions that presented their services tot he group. There was also a panel of local entrepreneurs that spoke of their experiences over drinks and snacks. It was a huge success and some of the participants have begun taking steps towards opening small businesses in Fatick.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/daniel_01_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/daniel_01_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a>
The goal of the project was to address the growing youth bulge in the city of Fatick through entrepreneurship training to encourage the economic development of the city. The <i>Conseil Communal de la Jeunesse</i> (Youth Community Council) and the <i>Association de Développment de Ndiaye-Ndiaye</i> (Ndiaye-Ndiaye Development Association) identified the need for entrepreneurship among young (17-22) men and women in Fatick as a major priority. This conference matches the expectations and the mission of the mayor as well as the participating organizations.</p>
<p>As a Small Enterprise Development volunteer, Daniel's goal is to build the capacity of individuals, businesses, and organizations. This training addressed two specific goals from the SED Project plan: Improving Organizational and Business Management Capabilities through Marketing, Costing, Financial Planning, and Accounting classes; and Training Youth and Women in Business skills by targeting young men and women between the ages of 17 and 22, with a 50% participation of women. </p>

<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p>The training had three main objectives.<br />
<ul>
<li>Encourage entrepreneurship among young men and women through an entrepreneurship training based primarily on the <i>Trie (Trouvez votre Idée d’Entreprise)</i> books, resource mapping, and other business activities.</li>
<li>Train the participants in business skills: Accounting, Marketing, Costing, and Financial Planning through 2-3 days of intensive training using a community-based certified <i>GERME (Gérez Mieux votre Entreprise) </i>trainer.</li>
<li>Provide linkages to other businesses and resources through sessions with micro finance institutions and government bodies that offer support to entrepreneurs. There will also be a panel of individual entrepreneurs that will talk about their experiences, and provide valuable expertise on the subject of starting a business.</li></ul></p>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/daniel_02_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/daniel_02_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" /></a>As a weeklong conference, this training provided young talented individuals and community leaders with business skills. This will increase their capacity to start and run small businesses and stimulate the local economy.</p>
<p>The training included members, and leaders, from the <i>Conseil Communal de la Jeunesse, Association de Développement de Ndiaye-Ndiaye, and the Association des Enfants et Jeunes Travailleurs</i> that will use their knowledge to help their organizations as well as start their own businesses. The individuals trained were required to present a brief summary to the organizations sponsoring their attendance.</p>



<h3>Results</h3>
<p>After the training, three individuals opened began the process of opening new businesses in the city. They have gained financing from the local finance institutions in Fatick and have begun the long process of investing and running a new business. Other participants have taken their knowledge and used it within their organizations to better manage the finances and expand the organizational capacity of these organizations.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>Working alongside the governor’s office the volunteer is assembling lesson plans to send out to the departmental capitals of the region of Fatick and will train professors on how to elad similar workshops throughout the region during the summer vacation months</p>
