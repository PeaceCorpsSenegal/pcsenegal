<h3>Summary</h3><p>A Peace Corps Volunteer in Barkedji worked with the director and teachers at Ecole Bamol Sow, one of the village’s three primary schools, to build a 20 x 40 meter garden on the school grounds. The garden, planted and maintained by Ecole Bamol Sow students and teachers, has provided educational opportunities for the students, income for the school, and a source of improved nutrition for the greater community. </p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/april_03_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/april_03_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a>
When the Peace Corps Volunteer arrived in the village and instigated discussions about Barkedji’s needs and desires, community members named a school garden at Ecole Bamol Sow as a priority. The school had been walled in the previous year, providing adequate space and protection for a garden for the first time. The village felt that the garden would provide numerous educational, economic and health benefits to the school’s 482 students and 13 teachers, as well as the greater community.  </p>

<p>Barkedji is located in a semi-arid zone where access to healthy produce is limited. A school garden would provide an easily accessible and reasonably priced source of vegetables to the community. These vegetables would increase the area’s food security, one of the three regional goals targeted by Peace Corps Volunteers in the Linguere area. The sale of produce would also provide income to the school, which would enable the school to cover water costs, maintain or replace fencing and tools, and purchase related lesson materials. In addition, the garden would present numerous hands-on educational opportunities for the students of Bamol Sow, including expanding environmental awareness, improving technical knowledge and encouraging social responsibility, teamwork and management skills. </p>

<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/april_04_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/april_04_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright"/></a>The Volunteer worked with teachers and the director of the school to write a Small Projects Assistance (SPA) grant that provided funds for metal fencing, a concrete water basin, a water pipeline extension, gardening materials, and enough seeds for an initial planting. The school provided some building materials and labor costs, and the Ministry of the Environment donated many additional gardening supplies. An elected committee of teachers oversaw the creation of the garden space and the handling of grant funds.</p>
<p>Once the garden was built, a select group of fifteen students worked with teachers to plant and maintain the garden. They also worked together to plant trees around the perimeter of the garden. The students met daily after school to water the plants. Once the garden started producing vegetables, the school hired a community member to sell the produce at the market.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/april_05_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/april_05_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft"/></a>The initial results have been very successful. In its first season, the garden produced lettuce, eggplant, tomatoes, okra, pepper, and beans. Sales of the initial harvest of lettuce raised over forty dollars, which the school has put into a fund to maintain and improve the garden in the future. These revenues have allowed the garden to quickly become economically sustainable.</p>
<p>Because the garden was built toward the end of the school year, teachers have not yet led garden-based Community Content-Based Instruction (CCBI) lessons, which incorporate environmental lessons into the school curriculum, but they plan to start these lessons next school year. CCBI lessons will enable the entire Bamol Sow community to be involved with the garden.</p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/april_06_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/april_06_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright"/></a>The primary challenge has been the maintenance of the garden equipment and supplies. The water basin already has some cracks, and almost all of the initial batch of ten watering cans are broken. This problem can be attributed in part to low-quality materials, and in part to the fact that the children who work in the garden have been careless with the materials. Going forward, the school will need to find a solution—perhaps reinforcing the basin with higher quality materials and sensitizing the students about the proper use of equipment—to avoid having to purchase all new materials every season. A solution must be put in place for the garden to remain economically sustainable. Because students can be hard on materials, in the future schools should consider investing more money at the onset for high-quality supplies.</p>

<p>School vacations have posed an additional challenge. During the rainy season vacation, when the school is closed, the garden has become overgrown. This break has led to a loss of momentum. The school will need to inspire renewed interest from the students next school year for the garden to continue to be successful.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/april_07_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/april_07_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a>Teachers will purchase new supplies with garden revenues during vacation. In the coming school year, Ecole Bamol Sow will clean up and re-plant the garden, and teachers will begin CCBI lessons.</p>
