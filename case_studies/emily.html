<H1>AIDS Tournee in Podor</H1>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/emily_cole_03_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/emily_cole_03_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a>Recognizing high syphilis rates in their communities, PCVs organized an AIDS tournée in five villages. At each event they provided free syphilis and HIV testing and counseling to all interested community members. Syphilis tests are expensive and neither HIV or syphilis tests are available in the villages. Testing teams are required to travel to villages to do testing, but they rarely do, leaving many community members without access to testing services. Music attracted community members to the event and helped encourage people to stay to get their results. The party atmosphere also made the events popular with the villages. ICPs followed up with any community members who did not receive their results at the event or who tested positive for syphilis.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
PCVs found that there were high rates of syphilis in their communities and that community members did not have access to testing and were not following up with treatment. AIDS rates in Fuuta are low, but on the rise. The high rates of syphilis indicate that AIDS could spread rapidly if it were to gain a foothold in the area. In addition, community members were unable to answer the most basic questions about HIV transmission and prevention.</p>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/emily_cole_01_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/emily_cole_01_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright"/></a>PCVs targeted pregnant women for testing as syphilis and HIV tests are part of prenatal care. This gave organizers the opportunity to talk about the importance of prenatal care and to link the tournée to ongoing work in their communities. The testing was, however, open to everyone as there are high rates of congenital syphilis in the area and many children are affected.</p>
<p>
This project helped to highlight the risk of HIV/AIDS by linking risk of HIV infection to the risk of syphilis infection. Community members understand that there is syphilis in their community and are willing to get tested for syphilis even if they are not willing to be tested for HIV. Community members must travel (pay for transport) to get HIV or syphilis testing and syphilis tests cost 2000CFA. This project allowed community members to be tested in their own villages without any expenses and without having to answer questions about why they were traveling into town.</p>

<p>From start to finish, this project took about four months.</p>


<h3>Social and Cultural Challenges</h3>
<p><p><a class="gallery" href="photos/emily_cole_02_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/emily_cole_02_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a>PCVs encountered problems negotiating prices with partners. Whenever possible, have a trusted counterpart negotiate for you. PCVs also were not taken seriously as there have been no large PC projects in the area for a long time. The more you can emphasize that you are a professional, and sadly that you went to college, the more likely people are to listen to you. Going to meet with officials or health workers for the first time it is best to go with another volunteer, especially if you are not comfortable speaking French. Try to go to every meeting with a specific demand. Asking someone for something specific gets better results than asking in general for help or support.</p>

<p>Even double-checking multiple times with partners is no guarantee of success. People will cancel without warning and it is always best to keep things simple and to have a back-up plan. An acting troupe cancelled at the last moment and despite promises that the testing team would do a causerie during the event, they refused each night.</p>

<p>In the villages, information rarely passes as it should. In one village community members were told the event would happen in the morning instead of the afternoon. In another the village chief told the community there was a free clinic and people were upset. Power outages and other technical problems arose and were resolved.
Holding a separate event to educate the community about HIV/AIDS and other STIs before the event makes the testing day less chaotic and is a great way to advertise the event. The Life Skills manual and the Scenarios du Sahel videos are great resources.</p>

<h3>Project Outcomes</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/emily_cole_04_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/emily_cole_04_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright"/></a> Hundreds of people were tested for syphilis and HIV. The individual counseling provided before and after testing also helped to educate the community. The one-on-one counseling from health professionals in the local language is the most important part of the activity. Widespread testing demystifies testing and helps to establish regular STI testing as a social norm, but if people live far from a testing site, testing must be brought TO THEM.</p>
<p>For the testing team and other partners, the tournee showed them the interest in testing and need for more services in the villages. It is within their mandate to travel to the villages to do this kind of testing, but with no per diem, they are not motivated to carry out this kind of work. Health professionals were excited to do this work because it allows them to kill two birds with one stone: you are paying them and they also get to record all of the outreach they do at your event and all of the individual counseling of pregnant woman (mother-to-child transmission) they do during the tournee. Working with your health center may allow you to make these activities a regular part of their work.</p>
<p>For the PCVs, this project strengthened their ties with local partners and helped them establish relationships with other community actors. Although a similar project is hard to organize early in your service, it can help to show other community actors that you are serious and committed to your work.
Medicos del Mundo has now agreed to fund HIV testing in an additional village in the area that could not be reached with this project. Although there is no support for syphilis tests, the success of the PC-led tournee has inspired the testing team to continue this activity without PC financing.</p>
