<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In response to gender inequity in education and limited opportunity for advancement for females in the area, for the past two years Linguere-area volunteers have collaborated to organize annual girls’ leadership seminars for female middle school students. These seminars coincided with the distribution of SeneGAD’s Michele Sylvester scholarships. Given the successes of this project, including the girls’ acquisition of leadership and decision making skills and the communities’ growing awareness of the importance of female education, volunteers are planning to institute this project as an annual event.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/lougagirls_700_01.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/lougagirls_200_01.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft"/></a>In the department of Linguere, most female secondary students come from rural families that place a high emphasis on traditional gender roles. Most girls are expected to marry young, produce children and take care of their families. Continuing in school through the teenage years is a new phenomenon, and girls are not always supported and encouraged by their families in this area. While there is gender parity in primary education in the area, the statistics show that the ratio of female to male students drastically declines in middle and high school. In addition, those who are able to continue their studies struggle to balance school work and their domestic responsibilities, which include cooking, cleaning, drawing water, taking care of children, etc.</p>
<p>To address these issues and to build on previous gender development work in their communities, Peace Corps volunteers from around Linguere decided to collaboratively organize girls’ leadership seminars. They timed these seminars to coincide with the distribution of Michele Sylvester scholarships, funded by SeneGAD. The seminars served as an educational tool to promote leadership, decision-making skills, education and career planning and as a celebration of the scholarship candidates’ hard work, accomplishments and commitment to their education.</p>


<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/lougagirls_04_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/lougagirls_04_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright"/></a>The first seminar was held in November 15, 2008 at the Centre Polyvalent de Linguere and was a full day event drawing participants from Dahra, Linguere, Nguith and Barkedji. The day included introductory remarks by a Linguere SCOFI (Scolarisation des Filles) representative on the importance of girls’ education; a screening of Elle Travaille, Elle Vit—a film created by Peace Corps Volunteers about working women in Senegal; a leadership workshop led by Peace Corps trainer Awa Traoré, and an HIV/AIDS awareness session led by Anne Langdji and Mariame Hanne, representatives of the Lutheran Health Project in Linguere. The participants were provided with lunch and a pause café. Volunteers concluded the seminar by congratulating all of the participants and announcing the scholarship winners.</p>
<p>On November 14-15, 2009 volunteers held seminars in Barkedji and Ouarkokh, the two communities where volunteers facilitated Michele Sylvester scholarships. Each of the morning sessions, which took place in the villages’ maisons communautaires, began with a malaria-themed icebreaker followed by the filming of Elle Travaille, Elle Vit. The subsequent dialogue segment included presentations by prominent local women about their educations and careers along with Awa Traoré’s leadership workshop, which consisted of large-group and small-group discussions.  Then we took a brief pause café. The closing ceremony included the distribution of participation certificates and school supplies, the recognition of the Michele Sylvester scholarship candidates, and the delivery of the scholarships to the two winners.</p>
<p>Both seminars were funded through SPA grants.</p>  

<h3>Results</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/lougagirls_02_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/lougagirls_02_225.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft"/></a>Thirty-five female middle school students participated in the 2008 seminar. In 2009 51 females participated in the seminar held in Ouarkhokh and 56 females participated in the seminars held in Barkedji. </p>
<p>The goals of the project were to give the girls an opportunity to envision and plan for their futures, to help them acquire confidence and decision-making skills that will help them overcome future challenges, including early and forced marriage, violence (including harassment and rape), poverty and a lack of resources, and to encourage them to continue their studies and strive to meet their potential.</p>
<p>Observation and community and participant feedback has shown that the seminars were successful not only in providing the individual girls with new skills and information, but also in creating awareness within the communities of the importance of female education and leadership. For some of the girls, this was the first time they were able to participate in an open dialogue with their peers and village leaders about the challenges they face.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>Individual volunteers have followed up on the seminars by working with the participants in their villages through gender development activities and youth groups. In future years, area volunteers will continue to facilitate Michele Sylvester scholarships for middle school girls, and will also run the annual leadership seminars. Each year as they plan these seminars, volunteers will reflect on the success and effectiveness of past seminars in order to refine and improve the model. Additionally, in future years, first and second year volunteers will collaborate in order to ensure the continuation and improvement of this project amid frequent volunteer turnover. </p>
