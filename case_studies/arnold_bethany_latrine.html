<h1>Community Simple Latrine Project</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>A Peace Corps Volunteer worked with her community to create and implement a successful simple latrine project in order to improve the health situation and reduce the occurrence of diarrheal diseases in the village.  Hygiene and sanitation issues are some of the most prevalent health problems in rural Senegal, yet most are relatively simple to solve through the installation of simple latrines and clean drinking sources.  Volunteers in every sector can encourage positive hygienic practices.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Health Education PCV Bethany Arnold (2008-2010) worked with community members in her small ethnically Serere village in the Fatick Region to create and implement a village-wide simple latrine project.  The need for a village latrine project was realized during a community PACA (Participatory Assessment for Community Action) meeting discussing the top health concerns of the village.  Hygiene and sanitation issues were identified as the most pressing health needs, specifically the lack of available proper latrines.</p>
<p>At the time of the meeting, only 12 latrines existed in the village, only 6 of which were considered strong and stable enough to sustain several years of use.  Most of the existing ones were constructed with mud and sheets of tin and risked collapse at any moment, especially during the rainy season.  Residents living in homes without any latrines would use neighbors’ facilities or the bush and forests behind their homes.  The village primary school did not have any latrines for student use neither did the teachers’ compound have its own latrine.  Students were relieving themselves next to one another, right outside of the stick classrooms, just a short distance from where their peers were learning.</p>
<p>At the same time, the nearby village of Pethie, with the help of PCV Marc Seidel, also identified the need for latrines as a village priority.  The year before, PCV Seidel had built 8 simple latrines in Pethie but had not used a grant and wanted to expand the project to more households.  PCV Seidel needed PCV Arnold to manage the project in Pethie when he COSed from the village in the spring.  In addition, Volunteers in the greater Fatick, Kaolack, and Kaffrine Regions identified the creation of proper village latrines as a priority for PCVs, as part of the Kaolack Regional Strategy, in an effort to improve the overall quality of living in communities where PCVs work and live.  The need for a gigantic latrine project was there and the timing was perfect to effect real change in PCV communities.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>The goal of the project was to improve the overall hygiene and sanitation levels, and therefore, improve the health of the residents of both villages, by having every compound in the village have at least one functional latrine.  The school would receive two latrines and the teachers’ compound would have its own as well.</p>
<p>A Peace Corps Small Project Assistance Grant ($ 1,000) as well as a Peace Corps Partnership Grant ($1,600) were used to build 61 latrines in the villages of Ndiomdy (42) and Pethie (19) over the course of four months, before the arrival of the rainy season.  Cement, iron reinforcement, and PVC pipes were purchased locally for the construction of the latrines.  Gravel, labor to dig the latrine holes, and a contribution of $4 (2,000CFE) per latrine for the mason’s labor were provided by each household receiving a latrine.</p>
<p>The construction of the latrines was simple: a 2m deep hole with a 1m diameter, covered by a 2m x 2m cement platform (with a hole and space to squat) reinforced with an iron frame to support the cement, a PVC aeration pipe covered in mosquito netting to help cut down on flies, and then a lid or cover over the hole, to be provided by each family.  One compound in the village had a latrine of similar construction that was built in 1982 and was still in use in 2010.  Whenever the 2m hole filled up or collapsed, the family would move the platform onto a new hole relatively easily.  The entire village was familiar with this latrine design and immediately understood and supported the project.</p>
<p>A skilled mason was hired from each of the two villages and could build two latrines in one day, using 2x4 wooden planks to make the form of the cement platform.  Each family that wanted a latrine turned their $4 contribution in to the village chief, who then gave it to the PCV to distribute as the masons after every 5 latrines completed.  The order of latrine construction was determined by the order people paid their contribution to the village chief.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Before the project began, the village of Ndiomdy only had 12 latrines of varying quality between 36 family compounds.  After the first year of the project, the village has 49 proper and well-built latrines.  While the exact number of children and adults suffering from diarrheal diseases before and after the project is unknown, villagers have shared that instances of diarrheal diseases have greatly decreased and student attendance increased, due to the installation of latrines at the school as well.  The quality of life for young and old in the village has noticeably improved.  The president of the local Rural Community (Communauté Rurale de Djilor Saloum) identified this project as one of the most positively impactful projects by an outside actor in the area—sharing that no other previous project has positively impacted so many people so quickly or transformed an entire village the way the Ndiomdy and Pethie latrine project did.</p>
<p>The success of the project was not just limited to households that received latrines through the project.  A few community members wanted larger and fancier latrines with connected bathing areas, and motivated by the greater community project, took it upon themselves to build new latrines at the same time.  Turning the project into a real learning and community education experience, teachers taught lessons to their student on the importance of hand washing and diarrheal diseases, as well as why it is important to always use a latrine and not just relieve one’s self anywhere.  PCV Arnold led many informal discussions with women, men, and children about latrines, their importance, and the importance of hygiene and sanitation. Beyond just the installation of latrines, village and community members now understand the value of latrines for positively impacting the health of an entire village.  Knowledge leads to positive behavior change.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>By popular demand, and due to some remaining funds, the project has been continued for a second year.  There was enough remaining funding from the two grants to build 13 more latrines between the two villages, which has been taken up by current Pethie PCV Mary Haviland.  Ndiomdy will receive 6 more latrines and Pethie will receive 7 more latrines.  Nearby villages, seeing the positive impact latrines made in Ndiomdy and Pethie, began talking to friends and relatives and asking the local PCVs about the project.  The need for even simple proper latrines was so much greater than was originally realized, so with two new Appropriate Projects Grants, the project has also been expanded to the villages of Dagasoukoum and Mbind Waly.</p>
<p>Continuing educational talks will be necessary to ensure that latrines are being properly taken care of, that lids or covers are being placed on the holes to cut down on flies, and that people are properly washing their hands with soap and water afterwards.  Further follow-up will be important to ensure that when the latrines fill or collapse, the platforms get relocated to new holes and continue being used.  Simple latrine projects and community education can save individual lives and entire communities from diarrheal diseases, improve a community’s health situation, and provide a PCV with fulfilling and impactful work.</p>
