<H1>Teen Pregnancy Project</H1>


<p> Preventing Unwanted Teenage Pregnancies in Middle Schools, Laura Massengale, Kolda region,
Foulamory</p>
<p>This project educates a group of volunteer students (“relays”) in sexual education.  PCV’s assist these students to conduct sexual education health talks with their classmates once a month, educating and urging reflection on risky behavior. </p>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/lauramass_01_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/lauramass_01_200.jpg" id="floatleft" border="0" /></a> A week after I arrived in my village, a 17 year old student in my compound gave birth to a baby girl. The student is unmarried and consequently the baby never received a ceremonial Muslim baptism: she is named after me. Kadiatou “Laura" is one example of the Kolda region's serious problem of unwanted teenage pregnancy, which often forces girls to drop out of school to marry or to raise the child alone.</p>
<p>I’ve found that these pregnancies are a result of several factors: sex is a taboo subject and girls feel ashamed to discuss the subject with teachers, health workers, and even their own mothers, preventing them from getting clear information on subjects such as their menstrual cycle. This taboo prevents them from seeking out condoms and even propagates myths discouraging condom usage.  Complicating this fact, poverty encourages girls to trade sexual favors with older men, teachers, and boys their age for money to buy clothes or hair extensions. Their family members often turn a blind eye to this type of situation, to avoid the shame of discussing a taboo subject (or perhaps to allow the girl to have this opportunity for funds).</p>
<h3>Approach</h3>
<p> In 2007, I conceived a program training a group of middle school students in sexual education so that they can, in turn, educate the rest of the student body as peer educators or “relays.” (This idea is inspired by Lifeskills, a manual that the Peace Corps frequently uses). I posed the idea to Mr Abdul Aziz Leye, a French teacher at the Sare Colly Sallé CEM.  Together, we designed a multi-day training covering adolescence and puberty, the menstrual cycle, unwanted teenage pregnancy, family planning, STDs and AIDS, and techniques for leading a health talk. He helped me write a grant proposal and we proposed our idea for this training to Medicos del Mundo, who gave their financial support and lent technical knowledge.  We implicated the health post nurse and other members of the community in the project by inviting them to teach certain sessions; the others were led by teachers and me. We held the formation in December of 2007 for 63 students.  I was there not as much to teach information (this was the teachers’ job) but to urge the sessions to be participative, breaking the students into small groups and inciting discussion. Discussions helped the students realize that the school is a safe space to discuss the taboo subject of sex.  The students praised the formation at its final evaluation, promising to be "evangalists" in sexual education.</p>
<p>For the rest of the school year, I met with the Relay-students to plan educational sessions with their classmates. We would pick a topic and a date, meet to plan it (often asking the nurse for help and obtaining condoms at the health post together), and ask permission to use a room at the school for the health talks. The relay-students were often shy speaking in front of their peers, but some lively discussions ensued and information was, indeed, relayed. The students were also excited to receive condoms, the first time they had ever gotten them at school.       </p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/lauramass_02_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/lauramass_02_200.jpg" id="floatright" border="0" /></a>Statistically, there was a positive change in the rate of teenage pregnancy: in 2007 there were 15 girls pregnant; in 2008, only 7. Teachers reported that students more frequently come to them with questions about reproductive health or even requests for condoms. We saw several girls became "leaders" who are confident initiating health discussions with their peers. Girls also had the opportunity to ask me questions about their menstrual cycle, and I referred them to other female teachers or the health post (to encourage sustainability rather than dependence on the Peace Corps.</p>
<p> I also identified several students (and even one girl student!) that are willing to distribute condoms to the rest of the student body and in their villages.  I connected them to the pharmacist at the health post, who now gives these willing students boxes of free condoms to distribute.  He reports an increased number of youth requesting condoms at the health post. 
<h3>Expanding the Project</h3>
<p>In light of the success of the project, Medicos del Mundo and the Peace Corps (now including volunteers from all sectors rather than just myself in health) continued the program in February in Sare Colly Sallé. In March 2009, we expanded it to the CEM in Diaobé, training 50 more students.  This is a middle school close to a large weekly market that is infamous for prostitution and AIDS.</p>

<p>In May, Maggie Pavelka and I teamed up with Peace Corps training staff member Awa Traoré to conduct girls’ leadership events with the student relays.  Awa’s Senegalese cultural knowledge combined with our regional knowledge helped her work to build girls’ self-esteem and self-respect.  A month after the camp, I had a conversation with one of the girls, asking her why she thought another girl in the community had gotten pregnant.  “It’s like Awa Traoré said: girls need to start respecting themselves,”  she told me.</p>
<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/lauramass_03_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/lauramass_03_200.jpg" id="floatleft" border="0" /></a>We do have some difficulties carrying out the program: students are busy with classes and are sometimes reluctant to put in time for extracurricular sexual education activities.  Frequent teacher strikes often prevent health talks from happening.  However, in addition to forming girl leaders, opening up a taboo subject to discussion, connecting students to local resources for information, and exposing and urging students to use condoms, the program has exposed health workers to current myths that circulate in the region.  During the health talks but also informally, I have learned common informational misperceptions that prevent condom usage, such as myths about virginity and myths about avoiding pregnancy (“one can’t get pregnant the first time!”).  The second year, we specifically addressed these myths during the training.  Medicos del Mundo is also developing a sexual education manual for middle schools using the information we have learned.  </p>
