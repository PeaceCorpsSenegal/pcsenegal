<H1>School Gardening in Fatick</H1>

<h3>Summary</h3><p>A Peace Corps Volunteer worked with her community and local teachers to create a school garden to improve student nutrition and assist the teachers in lesson delivery, while at the same time learning a practical life skill in gardening.  All PCVs, regardless of sector, can play an instrumental role in the development of school and other community gardens in order to improve food security, nutrition, and the quality of education across Senegal. </p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/bethany_03_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/thumbs/bethany_03_200.jpg" id="floatleft" border="0" /></a>Health Education PCV Bethany Arnold (2008-2010) worked with the primary school teachers and students in her small ethnically Serere village in the Fatick Region to develop a school garden to improve the overall quality of education in the village. The purpose was two-fold: 1.) to improve students’ nutrition levels through the regular inclusion of vegetables in the lunches served at the school cantine and 2.) to assist with lesson delivery by allowing teachers to take students into the garden for practical learning in subjects such as mathematics, science, and French.</p>  
<p>Across Senegal, academic lessons from the primary to secondary levels are lecture-based and with the lack of books, visual aids, and technology, students have very little practical or diverse methods to meet different learning needs.  Lesson delivery is usually dry, lacking creativity and student participation.  The school system is also plagued by constant strikes, making available class time precious, but ultimately resulting in low entrance exam scores.  Further compounding these problems is wide-spread malnourishment, with students rarely if ever having vegetables or fruits in their regular diet.  [In the Fatick region, fresh or dried fish is available most of the year and ground nuts are widely produced and consumed, so students receive at least the very minimal protein needs.]  The school cantine serves all students lunch twice a week during the academic year (when basic staples like rice, fish, and oil are available), but is rarely able to offer vegetables.  The lack of proper vitamins and minerals (such as Vitamins A and C, iron, potassium, etc) in the daily diet, however, takes its affects on a student’s ability to learn and ultimately lowers academic potential.  With all of these things working against students, something needs to be done, especially at the primary level, to improve the quality of education available to rural students.</p>  
<p>The groups specifically targeted for the project were the approximately 130 elementary school students, the three teachers, and one school director, all with little-to-no gardening experience.  The project was suitable for the chosen group because it was a self-identified need that was just in need of funding, the village had a proven history of being organized and motivated (including with a community women’s tomato garden), and the greater community was interested in the project’s success.  The PCV acted as a facilitator, connecting teachers, parents, local gardeners, and the Communauté Rurale with Peace Corps’ resources to get the project off the ground and successful, also encouraging the use of alternative gardening strategies.</p> 


<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p>A Peace Corps Small Project Assistance (SPA) grant (approximately $850) funded the establishment and maintenance of a functioning school garden measuring 20m by 25m.  Fencing supplies (chain link fencing, barbed wire, iron posts, cement) were purchased locally for the exterior fence.  A watering system including part of a metal barrel, iron legs for it to stand on, hoses to facilitate water movement from near the well into a cement water holding basin inside the garden also had to be constructed.  Seeds, fertilizer, watering cans, and other gardening tools were purchased or donated by the community.  Spaces within the garden were prepared for a vegetable pepiniere and successive transplanting, with students bringing manure from their home animal stables, and the PCV’s local counterpart in charge of plot creation and transplanting.</p>  
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/bethany_01_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/thumbs/bethany_01_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" /></a>Students as well as teachers worked in the garden and every class had at least one lesson in the garden during the first few months, while some classes met several times, in order to increase lesson variety and delivery options.  The CM1 and CM2 students were divided into watering teams, each taking a day of the week and watering in the morning and evening, to make sure that the garden did not go dry in the cool and hot dry seasons (January-May).  CM1 and CM2 students (as well as any others hanging around) also helped with weeding, plot preparation, and the creation of the tree nursery.  Students were involved in the harvesting and sales of crops from the garden in the greater community.</p>  
<p>The PCV and her local counterpart led informal gardening sessions with teachers and students after school in order to get all participants more familiar with basic gardening.  These informal trainings included explaining the pepiniere and transplanting process, weeding, proper watering, the creation of a tree nursery, basic mulching, wind blocks, and much more.  The school director took each class into the garden with their teacher in an effort to train all of the teachers in alternative teaching methods and introduce students to the school garden.  Other resources used included other local PCVs with gardening experience and Peace Corps print resources on gardening and pest management.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>The first year, the garden successfully grew lettuce, onions, carrots, tomatoes, hot pepper, bissap (hibiscus), and ground nuts, with plans for greater crop diversity and opportunities for improved student nutrition in successive years.  For the first time ever, local families had access to lettuce and carrots grown in the village, and had easier access to tomatoes, onions, bissap, and hot peppers.  Families got used to having vegetables on site and were thus encouraged to include them in daily meals.</p>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/bethany_04_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/thumbs/bethany_04_200.jpg" id="floatleft" border="0" /></a>The overhead cost of fence construction was an investment made to the future of the school.  The ultimate goal of this project was not income generation or profit, though there was a little involved (approximately $85).  The profit was used to buy more food for the cantine and saved for future needs.  Hopefully next year’s profits and general garden output will be higher through improved preventative, planning, and educational gardening tools.</p>
<p>Due to external conditions (lack of rice and oil for cooking), the school cantine was only able to serve lunch for one month, at the end of the school year.  However, all of those lunches served students vegetables grown in the garden, including carrots, tomatoes, and onions.  Even if a student’s family did not have money to buy vegetables from the garden or at a local market, all students had access to vegetables at school twice a week during this brief period.</p>  
<p>Encouraged by progress made at the school garden, at least ten new families in the village started home gardens for the first time ever (as opposed to only three families in prior years), through purchasing leftover seedlings as well as buying and planting their own seeds.  This number will need to be maintained and built upon in successive years, encouraging more families to become responsible for their own food and family nutrition.</p>
<p>In the first year of the garden, approximately 12 class lessons (mainly science d’observation and mathematics) were held in the garden, mostly with the CM2 and Ci1/Ci2 classes, with plans for more in the coming academic year.  Through hard work on the part of both students and all of the teachers, 16 of the 21 CM2 students passed their CFEP (Certificat de fin d’études primaires) exam, including 5 of the 6 girls in CM2.  While saying that the school garden was primarily responsible for these results is an overstatement (this was also the first year Ndiomdy had a CM2 class), the garden and regular access to vegetables could only have helped.  As the CM2 class was one of the groups most involved in the garden (working and classes), they had the most exposure to alternative and practical learning methods which may have helped with their test scores.  Further evaluation will need to be done to monitor such success rates.</p>


<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/bethany_02_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/thumbs/bethany_02_250.jpg" id="floatright" border="0" /></a>Everyone involved in the project (students and teachers alike) learned a great deal about the technical and logistical aspects of keeping a garden, so they will better know how to handle things next year.  Future costs will be minimal, including purchasing seeds and fertilizer, and maintaining the working condition of the fence and equipment, which can also be covered by school revenue from vegetable sales.</p>
<p>In the second year, the diversity of the school garden crops will be increased to include not just tomatoes, carrots, lettuce, onions, and bissap, but also watermelon, okra, jaxatu (bitter eggplant), green beans (haricots), eggplant, and cabbage, as well as the cultivation of an already-planted moringa seed bed for intense leaf cultivation in order to further improve student nutrition and village access to a greater variety of vegetables.</p>
<p>With the support of community members (a school, a women’s group, or any other group) and minimal seed funding, available through Small Project Assistance (SPA) grants as well as USAID’s Global Food Security Initiative, PCVs can work with their host communities to become more food secure through the creation of functional community gardens.  In addition to improved food security, the location of gardens on school property can assist in lesson delivery as well as improving student nutrition through use in the school cantines and improved access to vegetables.
