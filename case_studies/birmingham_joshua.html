<h1>Podor Dispensaire Garden Training</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The Podor Dispensaire Training was solely focused on gathering local gardeners and women’s groups presidents together at the garden in Podor so they can learn new and innovative gardening techniques.  With the help of my fellow PCVs in and around Podor we set forth to do a two day training at the Podor Dispensaire.  Fifteen Senegalese people participated in the PowerPoint presentation on the evening of April 23rd and the hands on demonstration of gardening techniques on April 24th.  The two day training allowed them to see beforehand what we would actually be doing in the garden on the 24th, thus allowing them to ask many questions and allowing us to clarify any of their concerns they might have.  The training increased awareness and knowledge of new gardening techniques that could be practiced by them.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>This training grew out of the success that the Podor Dispensaire Garden was showing to the people of Podor.  The garden was started in July 2010 and all the practices and techniques that were eventually shown to the people during the training were put in place when I built the garden along with the help of my Senegalese counterparts.  After people saw the success of the garden and what I had accomplished, people were curious of what type of things I did and how they could do the same.  The training evolved from that desire of the people to learn from what I did in the garden.  The training was supposed to bring local gardeners and women’s group’s leaders to understand what I accomplished in the garden and how they could do it themselves.  The training was supposed to take place in March, but due to security issues it was pushed back to April.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>All 15 participants received a certificate of training showing that they had completed my garden training and were now knowledgeable on how to double dig; make natural pesticide; how to make manure tea and their own compost piles; how to dig zai holes; and how to use cheap and practical containers for gardening.  All participants have the knowledge, books, and presentation that I gave to each one of them so they could pass it on to the other people of Podor and share what they had learned.  The participants are now knowledgeable on how to identify key plant ailments and how to remedy their sickness.  They are also capable of identifying pests and how to combat them with natural pesticides rather than costly chemical pesticides.</p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>The two day system of training was a success in my opinion, but keeping all the same people that came the night before and not adding more people the next day was a little bit of a problem.  Some other people showed up to learn which was fine, but they should not expect the same thing as people who have been there from the beginning.  There were issues with my counterpart understanding certain dimensions of building a garden table which showed to be quite stressful.  My PowerPoint proved to be a little long which made us rush at the end of our presentation, which did not allow us to carefully go over all the slides to the participants of the training.  </p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>I will try to edit my presentation to make it shorter and more manageable with the help of Volunteer Support Assistant Tidjiane Diaw.  I would like to continue this type of training in Podor and elsewhere in the Department of Podor like the city of Ndioum.  I will try to follow up with the participants to this training and see if they have tried to do some of the things I have taught them to do during the training.  </p>
