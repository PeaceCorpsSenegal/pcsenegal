<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Peace Corps volunteers from central Senegal held the second annual Camp de Connaissance et Croissance.  The camp’s goal is to inspire and empower girls to reach their full potential and achieve their dreams.  Through a variety of workshops, games, and other activities the girls were able to recognize that they have the agency to set and achieve their own goals.  The week-long camp was attended by forty middle-school aged girls from the regions of the Fatick, Kaffrine, and Kaolack.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p><a href="photos/lynch_2_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/lynch_2_200.jpg" class="floatleft" /></a>In Senegal, girls’ education is often undervalued and overlooked.  Even the girls who attend school do not receive the support and encouragement to work hard and excel.  When girls return home after the end of the school day, they are expected to help with household chores such as cooking and sweeping instead of studying and doing their homework.  Their education is considered as less important because they live in a society that expects them to marry early and become “housewives.” They are not encouraged or given the opportunity to explore other careers and make their own decisions about their lives.</p>

<p>The goal of the camp was to show the participants that they do have the ability to determine their path in life and to encourage them to work hard in school, make their own choices, and strive to reach their full potential.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p><a href="photos/lynch_3_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/lynch_3_200.jpg" class="floatright" /></a>Volunteers selected two to four girls who are at the top of their class and showed motivation and leadership potential from the local middle schools.  During the last week of June, after the school year was complete, the forty girls spent a week at a hotel located outside of Sokone on the Sine-Saloum Delta.  The camp was run by Peace Corps volunteers and six Senegalese female counselors.  The counselors were women whose work is related to children and education and who are good role models for the campers.  They served as a resource and reference for the girls since they understood the cultural and societal issues that the girls were facing better than the volunteers whereas the volunteers were able to provide a new and fresh perspective.</p>

<p>Each day of the camp had a different theme that was used as a basis for the day’s activities.  The themes were identity, health, environment, gender, and careers.  Every morning began with yoga and leadership and teambuilding games after breakfast.  The rest of the morning was spent discussing different aspects of and questions about the day’s theme.  For example, on health day, the girls discussed the topics of nutrition, fitness, and sanitation with volunteers, and then had an opportunity to ask a female health worker anonymous questions about any health related topics.  After lunch, the campers had a short break and then did a craft or hands on activity, such as planting a tree nursery on environment day.  Every evening the girls played sports or went swimming.  Afterwards they met in groups with one of the Senegalese counselor to discuss what they had learned and how it was applicable to their life.  Then after dinner, there were fun night time activities such as a camp fire.</p>

<p>Throughout the week the girls were given questions related to the daily themes and time to answer these questions in their journals.  These questions formed the basis of the daily discussions with their groups which was led solely by the Senegalese counselors.  This gave all the campers time to express their thoughts, feelings, and questions to a receptive role model.  During the time with the group, the girls also wrote skits about the themes of the camp to help them fully understand and express what they had learned.  Each group then presented their skits to the rest of the camp at the end of the week.</p>
        
<h3>Results</h3>
<p><a href="photos/lynch_4_700.jpg" class="gallery"><img src="photos/thumbs/lynch_4_200.jpg" class="floatleft" /></a>Throughout the week the participants, showed great interest in all the discussions and activities and were actively trying to determine how it could apply to them and their life.  At the end of the camp, the girls were very excited about all the new things they had learned and the first time experiences they had had.  They wanted to share these things with their friends and family at home which would further disseminate the lessons from the camp.</p>

<p>The Senegalese counselors also benefitted greatly from the camp.  Most of the counselors are teachers and those that aren’t work in the education field in a different capacity.  They now have new ideas and teaching methods that they can use in their classrooms in order to reach more students and keep them interested and excited about learning.</p>
  
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>Volunteers will hold the third annual camp next June in order to give even more girls the opportunity to participate.  Building on the success and lessons learned from this year’s camp, the next one will have even more community support and more experienced counselors because all of the counselors will be in their second or third year.  The community partner has also expressed interest in organizing a separate camp based on this model for the girls specifically in its program.</p>

<p>Volunteers will also continue to follow up with the girls from their towns that came to this year’s camp.</p>
