<h1>Peer Educator Training</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>A Peace Corps Volunteer worked with local teachers and fellow Volunteers to hold a peer educator training for students from two middle schools. The event trained student leaders in reproductive health, enabling them to host educational programs in their communities and schools. The larger goals of this program are to reduce the instances of early marriage, teenage pregnancy, and STIs, especially HIV, in the area.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/peereducator_1_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/peereducator_1_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a>Health Education PCV Bethany Arnold (2008-2010) worked with her community and local teachers from two different area middle schools to create and implement a peer educator (student relai) training in reproductive health. HIV prevalence rates remain relatively low in the area. The cases of teenage marriage and pregnancy among local middle school students are, however, on the rise and gave local educators cause for concern.</p>
<p>Middle school students from the 3eme, 4eme, and 5eme levels in Djilor and Sadioga were targeted for the project. While only 42 students and 3 teachers participated in the training, the peer educators were then charged with sharing the information with their classmates through educational programs, informal discussions, and community activities, expanding the reach of the program to over 1,200 area middle school students.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/peereducator_2_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/peereducator_2_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatright" /></a>Over the course of a 3-day weekend, 42 students (21 male, 21 female) and 3 teachers (2 male, 1 female) were trained as peer educators in reproductive health through the use of a USAID VAST grant to fund HIV/AIDS prevention strategies.  The training was inspired by reproductive health sessions led by area PCVs during the 2008-2009 academic year, requests from local educators, the Peace Corps’ Life Skills education program, and a successful peer education training program led by a PCV in Kolda the previous year.  The grant funded all aspects of the training, including breakfast and lunch each day, the creation (printing, binding, distribution, etc) of training materials, and uniforms for the trained student relais.  The goal of the training, called Ma Santé, Mon Choix, was to provide students with a basic knowledge of reproductive health and have them form teams to share their knowledge with their peers.  Sessions during the training included the importance and roles of a peer educator, adolescence and puberty, early marriage and teenage pregnancy, STIs, HIV/AIDS, family planning methods, male and female condom demonstrations, how to lead educational talks in the village and at school, and general Q&A with teachers and local health workers. The training also included screening film shorts from the Scénarios d’Afrique DVD and follow-up discussions, breakout brainstorming and action planning by school team, and an awarding of certificates of participation. Sessions were led by science teachers, Peace Corps Volunteers, the local nurse, a local Red Cross volunteer, and a few community health educators, known as community relais. To cover for the many games and activities prepared for but did not actually get to (this is Africa, things happen and you have to be flexible), thick folders were handed out with basic and more detailed information, class lessons, skits, and statistics about reproductive health. Students and teachers alike will be able to refer to that information and the local resource people identified throughout the weekend when they go to lead their own sessions.  The training was a tremendous success and students have already begun sharing what they learned through educational talks, informal discussions, and other activities.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>The training met its goal of training students to be peer educators in reproductive health, especially HIV/AIDS. It may take years, however, before anyone knows the long-term impact of the training on the lives of the student relais and their peers, in terms of reduction in cases of teenage pregnancy, early marriage, STI transmission, etc.</p>
<p>The impact of the training has already begun to be felt in the communities where the students live and attend school. The trained peer educators have begun sharing what they learned by leading monthly educational talks, informal discussions, and theater sketches. In addition to educating their peers on reproductive health issues, the peer-educators have become leaders in their communities, volunteering side-by-side with local Red Cross workers at large community events. They regularly work with adult community relais to disseminate information from the local health post and educate their communities through theater sketches. The teachers who participated in the trainings have been helping to organize some of the students’ talks, but the students showed up themselves to help at community events outside of the school setting. In April 2010, at the request of the students, an HIV testing day was held in Djilor and tested 45 students and community members. Another testing day is being organized for Sadioga in the near future.</p>

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/peereducator_3_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/peereducator_3_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a>The most important lesson learned has to do with organization and communication in preparation for the training.  Do not try to run a training like this completely on your own; it is necessary to use other PCVs, health professionals, teachers, and NGO workers to develop and present the material.  Organizing this type of training, and doing it well, with so many students and trying to get outside individuals (from schools, the government, NGOs, and the health structures) to participate can be a logistical nightmare. Frequent direct communication with all parties concerned is very important.  The actual lesson preparation required much more outside help than was used. The PCV created the training booklets herself because the ICP and school officials (SVT teachers, etc) were unavailable to meet ahead of time, but next time she would insist that everyone who was supposed to participate meet together at least a week before the training.  The teachers who were supposed to present sessions were unwilling to meet and therefore, not necessarily familiar with the material to cover, the way the PCVs present wanted them to cover it, ahead of time. When putting together the printed training materials for the students, consult with SVT teachers and the ICP to see if there is any other information that they would like specifically included.  Meeting with the teachers and health professionals ahead of time would also help get the entire team on the same page in terms of topics, health information, and gender attitudes to be encouraged.</p>
<p>Also, make sure to over-budget for certain things. Even though in the end there were fewer participants than originally planned for, the food budget was maxed out because the meat and fish needed for the daily lunches were abnormally high-priced at that time of year.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>The peer educators have proved themselves to be relatively independent and self-directed, enjoying the presence of area PCVs at their sessions, but not requiring their attendance in order to put on a community education program. PCV Arnold COSed in May 2010, but area Volunteers will continue to work with the peer educators and community counterparts to do a few afternoon follow-up sessions at the start of the 2010-2011 academic year. These sessions will check in on the progress of the student relais as well as teach new material and reinforce previous topics of instruction. Eventually, the idea is that the old student relais will train new student relais each year or so, to keep the lessons continuing at each school and perhaps spread to new communities. Perhaps more funding will be available for large-scale peer educator trainings like Ma Santé, Mon Choix in the future. If not, hopefully students, teachers, and PCVs can think creatively to continue to spread information about reproductive health.</p>
