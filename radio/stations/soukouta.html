<h3>Soukouta, Fatick</h3>

<p><img src="radio/stations/photos/soukouta.jpg" id="floatright" width="300px"/>Radio Niombato is a local station broadcasting from the village of Soukouta in Wolof and Sereer. Soukouta is right just next door to Toubakouta, a popular tourist destination south of Sokone. There are currently two teams of volunteers producing a monthly show, each of which then gets aired twice, for a coverage of 4 hours per month. Program topics range from latrine construction to American rap music. Most volunteer programs are recorded ahead of time, and consist of a mix of skits, interviews, and banter. The staff and technicians at the station are extremely friendly and accomadating, and working with them has been a positive experience for all volunteers involved.</p>
