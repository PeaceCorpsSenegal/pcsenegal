<H1>Peace Corps Volunteers on the Radio</H1>

<p><a class="gallery" href="radio/photos/radio_04_700.jpg"><img src="radio/photos/radio_04_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a>Peace Corps Senegal Volunteers are expanding their reach to many Senegalese beyond their host communities through the use of the airwaves. Local language radio is the primary means of mass communication in rural Senegal, particularly for those communities that do not have access to television, making it an effective tool for community development. Volunteers are currently working with community radio stations in Kaolack, Kedougou, Koumpentoum, Linguere, Matam, Pet√©, Saint-Louis, Saraya, Tambacounda, and Toubacouta. They produce their own shows in local languages and French. Programs include topics such as malaria prevention, agricultural techniques, American culture, and how to perform accounting for small businesses. They are presented in a range of formats, including radio dramas, in-studio discussions, and in-the-field interviews.</p>

<p>In 2009, Peace Corps Senegal and Tostan -- an international NGO based in Senegal -- received a generous collaborative grant of $50,000 from the U.S. Embassy in Dakar to build the capacity of local language community radio programming in Senegal. Volunteers Adam Horowitz (The Gambia '07-'09, Senegal '09-'10) and Natalie Rubin (Senegal '08-'10) organized an eight-day tour of the country during which they delivered newly purchased equipment to ten radio stations. They also conducted trainings for PCVs and radio personnel on the use of the new equipment and Audacity -- a free audio editing program that is helping PCVs and radio staff produce more professional sounding shows.</p>
