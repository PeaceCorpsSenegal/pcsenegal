Today's agenda started with me and able sous-chefs cooking a 450 egg omelet with sauteed leaves of the Moringa olefeira tree. Participants munched their eggs and learned more about a suite of appropriate technologies invented or adapted by Peace Corps Senegal Volunteers.</p>

<h3>December 3 2010 - 9:00 a.m.</h3>
<p>This morning is the start of the West Africa Peace Corps Volunteer Conference in Thies.  The agenda is filled with presentations on what Volunteers have learned about what works (and doesn't) in grassroots development.  <a href="index.php?page=resources/events/all_vol_dec2010/index.html">Here is the agenda.</a></p>

<h3>December 2 2010 - 8:00 p.m.</h3>
<p>Just finished our discussion for the seminar on International Development Theory and Practice. This week we read Dr. Steven Radelet's  Emerging Africa and Dambisa Moyo's Dead Aid.  We were fortunate enough to have Radelet, who is now Secretary Clinton's advisor on international development issues, on the phone with us for an hour from Washington, D.C.  He explained the thesis behind his new book, talked about how his Peace Corps service fundamentally affected his life, and answered Volunteer questions.  The Volunteers thought he had the most reasoned approach to development assistance, when they compared him to Easterly, Sachs and Moyo.</p>

<p>Had the chance yesterday to spend a few hours with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezekiel_J._Emanuel">Dr. Zeke Emanuel</a>, who is an advisor to President Obama on health care.  He is interested in ways to improve U.S. government international health programs and will be spending some time touring health care facilities today in the Koumpentoum area and meeting with Peace Corps Volunteers working on malaria prevention and nutrition projects.</p>

<h3>October 15, 2010 - 1:00 p.m.</h3>
<p>Today U.S. Ambassador Marcia Bernicat swore in 61 new Peace Corps Volunteers who will serve for the next two or three years across Senegal.  I’m proud of every one of them.  The nine weeks of pre-service training is grueling and they have all survived and even thrived.  They will be great representatives of their nation to the people of Senegal.</p>

<p>Here are some clips from the ceremony.</p>

<h3>October 7, 2010 - 4:00 p.m.</h3>
<p>On the same day that we saw this uplifting NBC News piece on the newly reopened <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39151931/ns/nightly_news-making_a_difference/" target="_blank">Peace Corps program in Sierra Leone</a>, we received the tragic news that a Peace Corps Volunteer in Niger has died, apparently of natural causes.  The Peace Corps emergency response has been set into motion from the conference here in Accra.  So sad.</p>

<hr />
<h3>October 4, 2010 - 6:30 a.m.</h3>
<p>16 hours after arriving at the Dakar airport,  Air Ivoire has delivered our little band of travelers (Dick Dick, Darlene Andrews, Jackie Sesonga, who is an advisor to Peace Corps programs in West Africa on programming and training, and myself) to Accra, Ghana.  We’re here for the annual conference of Peace Corps Africa Country Directors, representing the 27 programs we have on the continent.</p>

<hr />
<h3>October 1, 2010 - 12:30 p.m.</h3>
<p>Finished up three close of service interviews, which provides a chance for Volunteers who are completing their service to share their perspectives on the Peace Corps/Senegal program and make recommendations on how to improve our operations.  It’s an important moment for reflection before the transition back to America, or something else.  Thanks again for your service Maggie Byrne, Daniel-Robles Olson, and Jessica Young!  (And everyone else who is finishing service this season…)</p>

<hr />
<h3>September 30, 2010 - 4:00 p.m.</h3>
<p>Spent the day in Thies with 61 trainees and more than 100 Senegalese work and government counterparts.  This is a tremendous chance for our soon-to-be Volunteers to get to know the people they will be working with soon, and for their counterparts to better understand the work of Peace Corps/Senegal and what we are trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>I was happy to be joined by new Peace Corps Chief Information Office Dorine Andrews and new Peace Corps Africa Regional Director Dick Day.  We’re proud that Senegal will be their first exposure to Peace Corps in their new roles.
Preparing for the visit to Senegal of the new Peace Corps Africa Regional Director, Dick Day, and the new Chief Information Officer of Peace Corps, Dorine Andrews.  It will be great to show off Volunteers and their projects to visitors from headquarters.  In addition to meeting Dakar and Embassy staff, they will visit Thies during the Counterpart Workshop, visit Kaolack, Kaffrine, and Joal area Volunteers and partners.  This will be their first Peace Corps visits in their new roles and I'm proud to have our Volunteers be their first impression of Peace Corps in the field.</p>

<h3>September 29, 2010 - 11:00 a.m.</h3>
<p>Just met with Bouba Ndour, the brother of pop-star and Senegal media king Youssou Ndour, to discuss ways that the new television station the Ndours launched, called TFM, might highlight the work of Peace Corps and promote better understanding of America and Americans by Senegalese.  It’s a great opportunity to work towards the second statutory goal of Peace Corps.  Here is a link to the <a href="http://www.fondation-youssou-ndour.org/" target="_blank">Youssou Ndour Foundation</a> .

<h3>September 23, 2010 - 9:00 p.m.</h3>
<p>On my way back from visiting the small village south of Keur Lahine Labe, in the region of Kaffrine, where Ousmane Willane, one of the master farmers from our food security program, was hosting an open field day.  He showed off a number of productive techniques he has been trying with the encouragement and support of our staff and Volunteers.</p> 
 <p>This sort of work represents for me the best example of the kind of partnerships we are trying to promote:  Volunteers working in teamwork with each other, with staff and with counterparts toward a common goal; agencies collaborating and learning from each other's activities, as demonstrated by the presence at the event by the other US government-funded food security including Wula Naafa, Projet Croissance Economique, and CLUSA;  Senegalese counterparts learning from each other and building their capacity—more than 100 farmers from around area attended the open field day and learned from Ousmane's hard work and experimentation.    I was able to give him a certificate marking his work in front of the whole community, helping to reinforce the societal value of skilled farmers.</p>
 <p>It was also an opportunity to continue to build the network of highly skilled, very motivated master farmer, as the other 4 master farmers in the Peace Corps program from the Sine-Saloum attended Ousmane's event.  We're hoping that exchange will engender some healthy learning, collaboration and maybe a bit of competition to everyone's benefit.  Soon, we'll start to post detailed profiles of each of our master farmer's on the PC/Senegal web site, including video interviews, diagrams of their fields, and findings from their work.  Thanks to all the Volunteers and staff whose efforts helped make the event such a success and a model to be replicated around the country. </p>

 <h3>September 17, 2010 - 6:00 p.m.</h3>
 <p>Just finished a three day workshop at Peace Corps Headquarters in Washington focused on helping the agency to develop an implementation strategy for the recommendations of the recent Peace Corps Comprehensive Assessment.   This Assessment, mandated by Congress in last year's bill that appropriated the largest single year budget increase in Peace Corps history, outlined strategies on:  how Peace Corps decides where to establish programs and leave countries; focusing our programming to maximize impact; improving technical training, especially given the reality that most Peace Corps Volunteers come with generalist backgrounds; using highly skilled Peace Corps Response Volunteers to help drive innovation; building partnerships to grow our "3rd Goal" efforts to bring the world back home; and improving Peace Corps operations through better use of technology and strong business practices.</p>
<p>We discussed and debated the priorities between and within these strategies and how best to turn them into reality.  I was happy to have the opportunity to share some of the innovative approaches Peace Corps/Senegal Volunteers are promoting and to learn from what others are doing.  In the end, I felt proud to be part of a group that was honestly and intensely trying to evaluate and fundamentally improve an institution about which we all care so much.  I promise to keep you up to date and ask your advice as this process quickly unfolds.  Here is a link to the text of the <a href="

<h3>September 13, 2010 - 9:00 a.m.</h3>
<p>This week the Trainees are visiting currently serving Volunteers for 4 days.  We aim to have them visit Volunteers from the same region and in the same work sector that they are in and some of them get to visit the Volunteers they are replacing and communities they will be working with.  This "demystification" trip helps make Volunteer life and service more real for the Trainees.  Most come back with a renewed enthusiasm for the rest of the very difficult training and more excited about getting on with the work of becoming real Volunteers.</p>

<hr />
<h3>September 8, 2010 - 5:00 p.m.</h3>
<p>Today was site announcement day.  More than 60 Peace Corps trainees found out where they are going to work and live in Senegal for the next two years.  We have a fun tradition here of taking all the Trainees out to the basketball court at our training center in Thies, which has a huge map of Senegal on it, blindfolding them, then positioning each of them on the map where they are going to work.  Everyone takes off their blindfolds at the same time and finds themselves standing next to their new neighbors.  This year's ceremony was during a torrential downpour, but everyone was a good sport about it.</p>

<hr />
<h3>September 2, 2010 - 8:00 p.m.</h3>
<p>Spent the day visiting Trainees in their training villages.  Until three years ago, most Peace Corps/Senegal pre-service training was conducted at our training center in Thies.  Essentially we created an island of Americans surrounded by a sea of Senegal and tried to get them to learn language and culture in the classroom.  Now, we have community-based training, in which most of the 9 weeks of training before they are sworn in is held in villages outside of Thies where 3-4 Trainees live with host families and are taught by a language and cultural facilitator, who also lives with a host family in the community.  The Trainees come together to the training center every week or two for group technical, medical, safety and security briefings.  Our language scores have gone way up since we moved to this model of immersion.</p>

<hr />
<h3>September 2, 2010 - 2:00 p.m.</h3>
<p>Just got off the phone with Amadou Fall, my long time friend who is now the Vice President of the National Basketball Association for Africa. (Conference call from my cell phone in a restaurant in Thies, linking Amadou in South Africa and another NBA staffer in New York.  Telecommunications still amazes me.)   We talked about ways to move ahead our plans to expand access to basketball courts across Senegal and combine the sports with leadership development camps like this one in Linguere: <a href="index.php?page=case_studies/basketball.html">Linguere Basketball Camp</a></p>

<hr />
<h3>August 24, 2010 - 5:00 p.m.</h3>
<p>Returning from the Thies training center where I had the chance to talk with the group of trainees about the role of Peace Corps and PC Volunteers in development.  Announced a seminar I'll be running on Development Theory and Practice in Senegal.  It will include a syllabus, with 3 conference calls, 2 in-person seminars scheduled around other All Volunteer events in December and February, and maybe a field trip, with Volunteers co-facilitating with me each call and event. Participants will be invited to contribute original papers, as well.  I'll be bringing in some outside speakers/participants for one or two of the calls and seminars.</p>
<p>This seminar is an effort to address the issue that a number of Volunteers have brought up to me—they want a structured forum in which to learn about international development theory and research in order to place their experience in Senegal into a broader context and help them think through the "role of the Volunteer in development" issue in a more informed way.</p>

<h3><a class="gallery" title="Fall 2010 Agriculture Trainees" href="blog/photos/blog_newtrainees_01_700.jpg"><img src="blog/photos/blog_newtrainees_01_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" /></a>August 16, 2010 – 1:00 p.m.</h3>
<p>Today, the new group of Trainees heads off to their training villages to begin their experience of immersion in Senegalese language and culture.  Since we adopted this “community-based training” model, Trainee language capabilities have improved dramatically and we have raised our minimum local language proficiency standard at the end of the 9-week pre-service training from Intermediate-Low to Intermediate-Mid.  Fully half of the last group actually achieved Intermediate-High or Advanced in languages such as Wolof, Pulaar, Mandinka and Sereer before being sent off to their Volunteer sites.  This communication ability, and integration into the host communities that it facilitates, is a key part of the foundation for successful service, and an attribute that sets PC Volunteers apart from other development workers.</p>

 <p>This evening I said thank you to 34 Volunteers completing there service.  However, nearly half of them are planning to extend their time with Peace Corps, some by a few months, others by a full year, and two intend to transfer to other Peace Corps posts around the world.  So, for many, it was indeed “Thank You!” but not yet “Goodbye.”</p></td></tr>

<h3>August 11, 2010 - 8:00 a.m.</h3>
 
<p>Greeted 64 new Peace Corps/Senegal trainees at the Dakar airport this morning, which is the largest class we have ever received.  They arrived early and with all their luggage, which I will take as a good omen.  They are a great mix of Agriculture, Agroforestry and Small Enterprise Development future Volunteers.  Many are straight out of college, but a number have very significant work experience and advance academic qualifications.  They will be a fantastic addition to our team.  We’ve now got 216 Volunteers and Trainees in Senegal.</p>

<p>PCVs helped NBA and WNBA players with translations at an event at the Dakar YMCA today. NBA Cares has helped the YMCA refurbish their basketball court, build a library and establish a computer and study center.  We will follow up with Dakar-based Volunteers helping out the YMCA moving forward to help make sure these donations have lasting impact.</p></td></tr>

<h3>August 6, 2010 – 7:00 p.m.</h3>
 
<p>Back from distributing mosquito bed nets in Rufisque, part of the national program to provide universal coverage so that every person in Senegal will be able to sleep under a long-lasting, insecticide treated, bed net by 2011.  This approach was pioneered by PC/Senegal Volunteers Saraya  and Velingara areas.  Today, Volunteers and I were helping NBA and WNBA players and coaches distribute nets and provide malaria prevention education, as part of the United Nations Foundation’s Nothing but Nets initiative.  A dozen Volunteers helped NBA stars such as Dikembe Mutombo, Danilo Gallinari (New York Knicks), Senegal’s own  DeSagana Diop (Charlotte Bobcats) and Ronny Turiaf (New York Knicks), hang up nets.  Believe me, Dikembe Mutombo was born to hang mosquito nets.</p>
