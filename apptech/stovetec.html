<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>A StoveTec "rocket stove" was tested by 6 women in the village of Kassack Sud.  This trial allowed the local Peace Corps volunteer, Michael Burnim, to verify the efficiency gains advertised by StoveTec, to study the women's use and perception of the stove, and to gauge local interest in investing in StoveTec or other improved stove technology.  While some minor problems were identified, the StoveTec stove allowed women to cut their wood use by half or more, to spend less time cooking, and to drastically reduce cooking smoke in their homes.  The women testers, and other women in the village, are very enthusiastic about the possibility of purchasing a stove.  So far, thirty women have asked to sign up to buy a stove if and when they become available.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p><a class="gallery" href="apptech/photos/stovetec03_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="apptech/photos/stovetec03_200.jpg" id="floatleft" border="0" /></a>Worldwide, roughly 3 billion people cook with biomass in open fires, which due to their inefficient use of fuel and polluting emissions have negative effects on health, environment, and income.  Open fires are an inefficient use of biomass because biomass burns poorly in open fires and very little of the heat generated actually heats the cooking pot.  The pollutants produced by these fires are responsible for increasing the prevalence of respiratory infections and asthma in women and children, and they also contribute to lung cancer in older women.  Rigorous lab and field tests have shown that StoveTec rocket stoves, while producing 70% less particulate matter and 50% less carbon monoxide, require half as much fuel as open fires. The fuel efficiency of these stoves can reduce deforestation and can allow villagers to spend less time and money obtaining wood.  Combating deforestation also contributes to increased food security by preventing erosion and the loss of ground water and soil fertility.</p>
 
<p>In Kassack Sud, fuel wood is scarce and getting scarcer.  The average family is able to collect some wood on its own but still generally has to spend 3,500 CFA or more per month on wood that is brought to the village by horse or donkey cart.  (Given these conditions, a stove that reduces fuel use by half would save a family an average 1,750 CFA per month.)  Because of its location in the north of Senegal, close to the southern tip of the Sahara, Kassack Sud is a windy place where women are usually not able to cook outdoors.  As a result, women cook in poorly ventilated huts or rooms, and they and their children, who are often with them, are exposed to a great deal of smoke and carbon monoxide.</p>  

<h3>The Technology</h3>
<p>A rocket stove contains a combustion chamber with precise dimensions to ensure a controlled flow of air that allows for good burning conditions.  This combustion chamber is made from a thick  but very light clay that serves as insulation, allowing temperatures up to 800C. As depicted above, the stove comes with a metal "stick support," handles for moving the stove, a cast-iron top, and an adjustable "pot skirt" that envelopes the cooking pot, forcing the hot gases leaving the fire to rise along the sides of the pot, further heating the pot.</p>
<p>The "pot skirt" that came with the stove is not big enough to accommodate the pots used to cook lunch in the village.  To remedy this problem, the PC volunteer had a larger skirt made at a local market out of recycled sheet metal.  Currently, this locally fashioned pot skirt rests on bricks ringing the stove.  The volunteer and his counterpart in the village plan to solder supports onto the sides of the stove so that bricks will no longer be necessary to hold the pot skirt around the cooking pot.</p>

<h3>The Approach for Testing</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="apptech/photos/stovetec_01_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="apptech/photos/stovetec_01_200.jpg" id="floatright" border="0" /></a>Five of the 6 testers used the stove for a period of two to three days.  One of the testers, Rougui Thiam, now owns the stove and has been using it for several weeks.  Each tester was given the stove with a few instructions.  The PC volunteer briefly instructed them (3-4 minutes) to clean out the ash before cooking, to reduce the amount of wood burning after the water reaches a boil, and to use the "stove skirt" the volunteer provided.  The women were intentionally not given any training beyond this brief introduction so that the volunteer could study the ease with which the women learned to use and to adapt to the stove.</p>
<p>The volunteer observed the women cooking and the state of the stove during their trial use, and he conducted interviews with each woman after she had used the stove.  Each woman was asked how using the stove affected the duration of cooking, the quantity of smoke produced, and the quantity of wood consumed.  They were also asked about the ease or difficulty of cleaning the stove, of pushing in sticks of wood into the stove as they are consumed, and of having the cooking pot higher off the ground than it would be with an open fire.  Since most families in Kassack Sud obtain only a couple of days’ supply of fuel wood at a time, it was impossible to weigh the wood ahead of time and calculate exactly the amount of wood saved.  Similarly, the reduction of the amount of smoke could not be measured scientifically.  For these reasons, the women were asked to give rough estimates.</p>  
   
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>All of the women who tested the stove would like to cook with one, but one of the women has not been able to convince her husband that such an investment would be worthwhile.</p>  
<p><b>Smoke:</b><br />
Two of the testers reported that the stove produced no smoke after the kindling finished burning.  
(The stove does produce some smoke, but it may have seemed like none at all to these women because of the dramatic difference from an open fire).  Three of the testers reported that there was very little smoke, well under half the amount of smoke produced by an open fire.  One of the women reported that with this stove she could now cook in her nice clothing because it is not  ruined by soot.  Another woman reported that her eyes no longer smarted from the smoke in her kitchen.  One of the women testers experienced only a small reduction in the amount of smoke produced compared to an open fire, which may have been due to her not regularly cleaning out the ash in the stove.</p>  
<p><b>Wood Use:</b><br />
All of the testers reported reducing the amount of wood they used by half or more.  Four of the women said they could cook lunch with 2 pieces of wood instead of the usual 5 or 6.  One said she could cook lunch with 3 pieces of wood instead of the usual 6 or 7.  One women said she used between 2 and 3 pieces of wood to cook lunch instead of the usual 5 or 6.</p>
<p><b>Duration of cooking:</b><br />
All of the women reported that the stove cooked faster than an open fire.  They were asked "if you want to have lunch ready by 2:00 p.m., at what time would you start cooking with an open fire and at what time would you start cooking with the stove?"  On average, the women reported that cooking time was reduced by one-third.</p> 
<p><b>Maintenance:</b><br />  
None of the women reported difficulty cleaning the stove, but the Peace Corps volunteer observed that 2 of women did not clean the stove properly (i.e. they let ash build up).  If a larger quantity of stoves were brought to the village, the women should be better educated about the importance of keeping the stove clean.  They would probably be receptive to this information because it is easy to see that the stove works better when it is cleaner.</p>

<h3>Problems and Complaints</h3>  
<ol><li><b>Cooking pot "feet"</b><br />
The main problem with the StoveTec rocket stove would apply to most stoves.  Many of the pots used in the village have supporting legs that would have to be cut so that the bottom of the pot does not sit too high above the top of the stove.  This modification can be done locally, but it requires the women to be willing to modify their cooking pots.  So far, women testers and other women interviewed have stated they would be willing to do so because the pot legs are a dispensable feature of their pots.</li>
<li><b>Unsatisfactory performance with charcoal</b><br />     
Stove performance with charcoal was less than satisfactory.  If more stoves are ordered, they will be the less expensive StoveTec rocket stove that burns only wood.  Wood is virtually the only fuel used to cook in the village.</li>  
<li><b>Moving the stove</b><br /> 
The current set-up, with the homemade stove skirt resting on bricks, makes the stove harder to move.  The women anticipate this would be a problem in the rainy season.  As described above, the volunteer and his counterpart plan to solder on or devise another way to attach supports for the skirt to the body of the stove.</li>  
<li><b>The stove is not big enough to cook holiday meals</b><br />
This fact does not seem to be an obstacle to acceptance, although the women would like stoves large enough to accommodate the giant cooking pots they use during holidays.  It would not be economical, of course, to order larger stoves to be used on only a few occasions each year.</li></ol>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>The women in Kassack Sud are excited about the possibility of buying stoves.  Despite the volunteer’s protests that such an action was premature, one of the ASC's in the village, the volunteer’s counterpart, started a sign-up sheet for those who would like to buy a stove for 5,000 CFA, to be paid in monthly installments of 500 CFA.  So far, thirty women have signed up.  StoveTec has offered to sell Peace Corps Senegal a sample of thirty-six stoves.  The introduction of these stoves in Kassack Sud could provide a more extensive test of the viability of the stoves.</p>  
<p>If in the future a Peace Corps sponsored project or another organization would like to facilitate the use of these stoves on a wide scale, the stoves can be bought in bulk either fully assembled or in parts that can be assembled and added to in Senegal.  The StoveTec combustion chamber and the cast iron stove top are the parts of the stove that most affect its performance.  The exterior of the stove, the metal support for the fuel wood, and the "stove skirt" can be made locally out of any one of many materials. Finishing the manufacture of the stoves in Senegal could help make an effort sustainable, while importing finished stoves might lead to a faster rate of introduction and acceptance of the stoves.</p>
