<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Dr. Ben Bryant, University of Washington, first developed the idea while searching for cheap alternatives to oil fuels and high priced fuel briquette making machines.  He created a simple lever system to act as a press for agricultural residues, which he then implemented in some of the poorest parts of the world.  The pressed agricultural residues are used for cooking and heating and mostly serve as a supplement to charcoal and firewood.  By using fuel briquettes, deforestation can be reduced and the women who have to collect firewood are free to focus on other aspects of their lives.  The briquette press is a tool to aid in the fight against deforestation, declining oil energies and poverty.</p>

<p>The idea of the briquette press has been in Senegal for two years now without any substantial output.  This has been due to a few setbacks in purchasing construction and userâ€™s manuals, as well as finding a carpenter to make the press. However we do have a functioning press presently located in Kay Fara 2 in the Kaffrine region.</p>     

<p><a class="gallery" href="apptech/photos/bp_05_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="apptech/photos/bp_05_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a>We have looked into making the press out of metal instead of wood but found that the difference in price is not substantial.  The price for the first wooden press was 100,000 cfa but can be reduced now that the carpenter knows how to construct it.  The estimate for the metal press is 80,000 cfa.</p> 

<p>We have also had setbacks with creating a suitable composition of briquette materials.  As cautioned in the training manuals, creating the right mixture of materials to be pressed can only come through practice, practice and more practice.  We are still in the early stages of practicing.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<ol>
  <li><a class="gallery" href="apptech/photos/bp_04_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="apptech/photos/bp_04_150.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" /></a>Collect dry brown carbon materials such as corn stalks, leaves, grasses, millet chaff, waste paper, peanut shells, etc.</li>
  <li>Chopped these materials finely with a mortar and pestle or a hand crank threshing machine and place in a plastic sheet.</li>
  <li>Allow material to partially decompose.  Partial decomposition allows for the fibers to unbind while still not decomposed enough to become humis.</li>  
  <li>Soak materials in water to make a slurry-like paper mache.</li>
  <li>Use press to compress slurry into briquettes.</li>  
  <li>Dry the briquettes and they are ready to be sold or used.</li>
</ol>  

<h3>Benefits</h3>

  <li>A productive use for agricultural wastes normally burned or discarded</li>
  <li>A chance to start a new business to increase income and create jobs</li>
  <li>Briquettes serve as a supplement to wood pilfered from the forest meaning less deforestation</li>
  <li>Women spend less time searching for fuel and more time on other tasks resting</li>
  <li>The briquette press can be combined with other appropriate technologies to increase productivity</li>
