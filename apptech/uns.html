<h3>Senegal Project Overview</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="apptech/photos/uns_01_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="apptech/photos/uns_01_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a>The Universal Nut Sheller was developed in Malawi with the initial intent of shelling peanuts, and later it was discovered that it could be easily manipulated to shell coffee, jatropha, shea moringa, and most anything with a circular form.  It is made out of two cylindrical concrete pieces formed in a plastic cast, and the rotational force between the two cylinders shells the nut.</p>
<p>The project was conceived in August and has been in the initial testing and manufacturing stage until now.  The first ever UNS microenterprise is officially operational in the village of Khossanto, in Kedougou, and the project has reached a point at which expansion into other regions is possible.</p>  
<p>Using locally sourced materials, it can be built for 20,000 – 30,000 CFA, depending on the capabilities of local metal smiths.  If well-built, it could conceivably last 20 years.  It is a tremendous opportunity for small villages to increase the value of their peanut harvest, and could easily be coupled with a peanut butter operation, a shea butter facility or a Jatropha oil operation.</p>

<h3>The Manufacturing Process</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="apptech/photos/uns_03_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="apptech/photos/uns_03_250.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" /></a>The Universal Nut Sheller is essentially composed of only two pieces: an exterior shell and an internal rotor, both of cast concrete.  Using a specific mold kit sent from the United States, the exterior and interior are cast and allowed to dry for several days.  When fully cured, the rotor is attached to the exterior shell by means of metal mounting brackets at the top and bottom of the device.  A metal handle is attached, and the final product is mounted on a small metal stand.</p>
<p><b>Important Notes</b>
<ul><li>The internal surfaces of the concrete castings must be roughened during the drying phase so as there will be enough friction to spin-shell the nut inside.</li>
<li>The metal parts must be replicated to very specific tolerances to assure that the rotor will be perfectly centered within the machine.  Even millimeters can make a big difference in the percentage of peanuts broken during operation.  Here’s where you will do well to choose your metal smith very carefully.</li></ul></p>
<h3>Problems and Solutions</h3>
<p><i>On Construction and Assembly</i><br /> Finding a skilled metal smith is perhaps the most important part of the equation.  Once the metal pieces can be easily replicated, the rest of the project will come together very quickly. When casting the concrete pieces, <a class="gallery" href="apptech/photos/uns_04_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="apptech/photos/uns_04_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a>it is very important to let them sit and cure for several days before using the machine.  Premature tightening of the mounting brackets or operation could create cracks and ultimately destroy the machine.  During assembly, centering of the rotor is extremely important, and misalignment will crush peanuts, which is undesirable.<br /><br />  
<i>On Operation and Use</i><br /> Again, finding the right partner is very important.  Initially, the goal was to distribute through women’s microfinance groups, though in the end they proved to lack the cohesion or organization needed to operate a machine.  A single buyer/operator is preferable.  Peanuts need to be fully dried before put into the UNS, as wet peanuts tend to clog its rotation.</p>

1 Fiberglass mold set and shipping from US = $ 615<br /> 
Fabrication of 1 Metal Component Set = 20,000 cfa<br />
1 Bag of Cement = 4,500-5,000 cfa<br />
1 Load of Sand = 35,000 cfa<br />
1 support stand = 2,000- 3,500 cfa<br /></p>
