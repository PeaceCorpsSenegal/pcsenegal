<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Drying food by the heat of the sun is one of the oldest agricultural practices related to preservation. Fruit and vegetables were placed in the gaze of the sun long enough for moisture to escape, thereby preventing decay and spoilage.</p> 
<p>Food preservation by solar drying requires only the heat of the sun as an energy source. Minimal storage space is required, and once stored, no energy is needed to maintain preservation. Drying food is simple and does not need extensive training or special skills.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The need to dry produce stems from its high water content. Fresh produce may contain up to 95% water and is sufficiently moist to enable enzyme and microorganism activity. Therefore, the goal in drying is to lessen the water content to a level in which enzymes and microorganisms cannot thrive. Exact levels vary based on the produce, but necessary level holds around 10-15 percent. Moreover, too great a reduction results in frail and breakable produce.</p>
<p>Each year, millions of dollars of agricultural produce are discarded due to spoilage. Ignorance of preservation methods, negligible or nonexistent transportation systems, and the low price farmers receive during the harvest season are the major contributors.</p>
<p>Drying offers a solution to this dilemma, and if universally implemented, would offer considerable savings and nutritional benefits and boost the economic circumstances of many developing countries. Unfortunately, many of the places which would see benefit from solar drying lack information on how to implement this technology.</p>
<p>Regrettably, it has become the least used as freezers and canning has become more prevalent and accessible. However, in many developing areas, where resources are often limited, freezing and canning are not plausible options. Freezing is fast and simple but requires purchasing an expensive freezer and requires electricity to operate. Additionally, in areas where power outages are frequent, spoilage from thawing reduces effectiveness. Canning is more labor intensive than freezing but is generally unaffected by power outages. The start-up costs can be substantial and canned food requires a lot of storage space.</p>

<h3>Solar Drying vs. Sun Drying</h3>
 
<p><a class="gallery" href="apptech/photos/fruitdryer_02_640.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="apptech/photos/fruitdryer_02_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" /></a>The primary advantage of or sun drying (drying in the open air) is that minimal capital is required. Produce is laid outdoors, underneath the sun, and exposed to the elements. An important advantage of solar drying is that the product is protected from weather, insects, animals and dirt or sand. This drastically heightens sanitation and quality as well as a level of protection from weather. Additionally, solar drying offers control over the drying process at elevated temperatures, and can be faster, which greatly reduces the chances of the producing spoiling.</p>

<h3>Drying in Senegal</h3>

<p>There is a multitude of designs for solar dyers and an equal number of NGOs that have promoted them around the world. However, many good designs fail to be adopted by the people they were intended to serve. In our observations of failed solar dryer projects here in Senegal, we wondered if perhaps they failed because the designs were too good. While solar drying is a proven and useful technology, it does have its limits of usefulness. Namely, it cannot compete with oven drying for large scale commercial operations. This means that the target market for a solar dryer is small scale operations, and in Senegal that means women's cooperatives. However, a women's cooperative that is going to be drying mangoes, bought at a dollar a kilogram, typically cannot afford a $150 solar dryer. At least, they are certainly not willing to take the risk. In our opinion the cost of the solar dryers we have seen puts them out of the price range of the women's cooperatives that would use them. This realization made us wonder how cheaply we could build a usable solar dryer and would the resulting dryer be something that women's cooperatives would adopt. We started with free cardboard, then tried paper maché, then settled on this model as a compromise between cost and effectiveness. In fact, it performs so well that the other solar dryers we have seen just seem unnecessarily over built.</p>


<h3>The Technology</h3>

<p>The dryer uses a continuous flow of warm air around and over the produce to remove moisture. Air is trapped by the plastic covering and heated by the sun and magnified by the black interior. The temperature of the air increases and, by natural convection, exits into the box holding the produce. The hot air then continues to rise around the produce and exists through the roof of the box. The partial vacuum created in the box then draws in fresh air from outside via the opening at the base of the dryer.</p>

<h3>The Application</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="apptech/photos/fruitdryer_03_640.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="apptech/photos/fruitdryer_03_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a>During the West Africa Peace Corps Volunteer Conference in Dakar, volunteer Zack Swank presented his design for a solar dryer. Swank demonstrated the plausibility of creating a solar dryer using local products, the African sun, and at a minimal cost. Swank’s design incorporated a solar panel made from a piece of inclined zinc painted black that was covered with scrap plastic bags, thereby trapping and heating air.  As the heated air rose, it moved through several stacks of flour sifters placed one on top of the other and dried the fruit.</p>
<p>Intrigued by the simplicity and possibilities, volunteer Ryan Gorman returned to site and attempted to find a women’s cooperative willing to invest in the venture. After finding a cooperative and selling them on the idea, Gorman set out to construct a dryer. Since this cooperative sought economic benefit from solar drying, Gorman’s challenges in constructing this dryer were (1) the time and schedule constraints of the women, (2) providing adequate drying space, (3) constructing a design capable of withstanding transportation and weathering while (4) still incorporating local resources at an appropriate cost.</p> 
<p>Gorman modified Swank’s design, enhancing the size by incorporating a box design to house several kilos of fruit during drying. Gorman also added support to the edges and bottom to offer additional protection, should the dryer be left to the elements. A door and lock system were added to give extra functionality and easy access to the fruit. Additionally, the plastic covering was adhered to the wood support by nails driven only half way in, allowing for easy repair.</p> 
<p>The next step was testing. Gorman collected and dried some of the more popular produce, including mangos, apples, pears, bananas, okra, tomatoes, and peppers and revealed the dryer’s success to the women’s cooperative. The dryer demonstrated its capacity to produce several kilos of produce within.</p> 

<h3>The Test</h3>
<p>Intrigued by the potential, the women, aided by the volunteer, established a market test during which they sold dried mangos at an exposition. The week before the exposition, several kilos of mangos were dried and placed into individual sachets containing a few slices of mangos. Gorman worked with the cooperative to aid them in understanding costing and marketing concepts in order to maximize profits and further the cooperative’s interest in drying.</p> 
<p>During the exposition, all dried mangos were sold within a few hours to the surprise and enjoyment of the cooperative. Profits were 200% of costs and demonstrated the effectiveness of drying.</p> 

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="apptech/photos/fruitdryer_01_640.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="apptech/photos/fruitdryer_01_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" /></a>Working with the cooperative to further and maintain their interest in drying is imperative. Through classes in costing, marketing, accounting etc, Gorman will work to establish best business practices for the cooperative, maximizing output and profits. Furthermore, the volunteer is working with local partners and other Peace Corps volunteers to introduce dryers to other cooperatives within Senegal.</p> 
<p>Additionally, Gorman is experimenting with new and inventive dryer designs focusing on adapting solar fans as well as new layout attempting to capitalize on airflow and improve drying speed. As airflow is key to proper drying, maximizing airflow means is a substantial gain towards efficiency.</p>
