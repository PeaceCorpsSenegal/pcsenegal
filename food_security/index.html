<H1>Peace Corps Senegal and Food Security</H1><br />


<H3>Context</H3>
<p>Senegal is a low-income, food-deficit country of 14 million people. Approximately 80 percent of the population works in agriculture, depending on exhausted soils and rainfall that fluctuates from year to year. This has led to food shortages and poverty such that 26 percent of the population is undernourished and chronic malnutrition levels are particularly high among children under five.</p> 

<p>Food Security involves three key aspects: availability of food year round, economic and physical access to food, and utilization of nutritious options. </p>

<p>Significant improvement in food security is possible in Senegal. Potential yields of staple crops are often two to six times higher than what the average farmer currently harvests. The main obstacles to agricultural production growth are farmers’ access to agricultural technologies, information, markets, and credit; villagers’ short-term approach to resource management; and the majority’s spending and energy diverted from long term goals to address immediate needs. </p>

<p>Intervention at the grass-roots level is necessary to develop an integrated, effective, and sustainable approach. </p>  


<H3>Approach</H3>
<p> Peace Corps Senegal focuses on four major initiatives to promote food security:</p>

<H3>Results</H3>
<p>Since the Food Security Initiative began in September 2009, there has been tangible improvement in the availability, access, and utilization of food:

<ul><li><a href="?page=food_security/gardens.html">33 school gardens </a>created with the technical assistance of Volunteers--a total 1,449 participants including students and teachers</li>
<li><a href="?page=food_security/nutrition.html">55 nutrition trainings</a> conducted with 1,1015 participants</li>
<li><a href="?page=food_security/gardens.html">104 community gardens</a> working with volunteers to implement improved techniques</li>
<li><a href="?page=food_security/farmers.html">13 master farmers</a> trained and implementing demonstration farms</li>
