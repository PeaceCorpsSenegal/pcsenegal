<p>These projects are doable for volunteers across sectors. Technical support is available from nearby PCVs and the Food Security team in Dakar. </p>


<p><strong>School Gardens</strong><br />Gardens at a local school--Koranic, primary, college, or lycee--is a great way to incorporate environment and science in an outdoor, hands-on setting and can provide lesson material for nutrition education while improving access to nutrition at the same time.   </p>
<p><strong>Community Gardens</strong><br /> Shared gardens can capitalize on open, unused community lands and distribute management costs (fencing, tools, well construction or robinet installation, etc.) evenly among a group of individuals; such places  make it easy to share and spread improved garden technologies (drip irrigation, mulching, companion plantings, etc.), improve nutrition among its members, and supplement incomes through market sales.</p>
<p><strong>Garden/Agriculture Technical Trainings</strong><br /> Teaching  improved gardening and agricultural practices (permagardening, mulching, companion plantings, composting, zai holes, integrated pest management, alley-cropping, green manure, inter-cropping, etc.) helps promote quality garden care and results in better produce--higher yields, higher quality, hardier pest resistant varieties and seed stock, better taste, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Agroforestry Technical Trainings</strong><br /> Teaching how to grow, manage, and plant trees (nursery preparation, pruning, alley-cropping, fruit tree management, etc.) is vital for protection of Senegal's cropland and can lead to soil improvement, soil preservation, additional food sources, fodder, firewood, crop/garden protection, windbreak, etc. </p>
<p><strong>Moringa oleifera (nebedaye) Seminars</strong><br /> Projects detailing how to grow, cultivate, and utilize Moringa can not only enhance gardens through improving soil but increase nutrition (leaf sauce, juice, etc.) and provide additional marketable resources (powder, dried leaves, etc.) –it’s a tree easy to propagate and manage, and can offer numerous nutritional benefits once harvested. </p>
<p><strong>Grain Storage Facilities</strong><br /> Improving storage capacity provides the community with a safe place to keep seed until it is needed, decreasing the chance of insect/pest infestation or moisture damage and increasing the chance of good germination and high yields.</p>
<p><strong>Seed Collection Trainings</strong><br /> As another limiting factor in crop/garden yields is the quality of seeds, instructional sessions on how to select, process, and store seed for later use can increase yield and reduce costs involved with disease- and pest-ridden seeds.</p>   
<p><strong>Irrigation Systems and Training</strong><br /> As water scarcity is a huge problem! It makes dry-season gardening a gamble due to high costs and high demand (which local sources are often unable to meet), drip irrigation projects can help reduce the amount of water needed and used, thus ensuring production with minimal use and cost.</p>       
<p><strong>Nominate a Master Farmer</strong> <br /> Motivated, youthful, experienced, experimental farmers with natural teaching ability, good standing in the community, and a hectare of land to devote to project. Best if 2-3 PCVs nearby to provide cross-sectoral collaborative support.</p>
