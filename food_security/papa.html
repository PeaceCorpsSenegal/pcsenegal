<h2 align="center">Partnership with USAID</h2>

<p>The Peace Corps Senegal Food Security Initiative developed through a special Participatory Agency Program Agreement (PAPA) with USAID, as part of Feed the Future and the Global Food Security Initiative proposed by Hillary Clinton and the Obama Administration. The Peace Corps Senegal and USAID agreement includes $1.57 million for grassroots-level intervention projects. USAID has made similar PAPA agreements with Peace Corps Mali and Peace Corps Ghana. </p>

<h3>PAPA Goals</h3>
<p>Executed over four years, the anticipated benefits include:
<ul><li>Technical assistance to enable intensive <a href="permaculture.html">permaculture</a> of nutritious crops on 600 ha (the amount of cultivation needed to provide adequate nutrition to eliminate chronic malnutrition for 360,000 children, the estimated number in Senegal)</li>
<li>The training of 375 pilot farmers as agriculture experts</li>
<li>The pilot farmersâ€™ extending technology to 42,500 community farmers</li>
<li>The establishment of 600 new school gardens and 300 new community gardens</li>
<li>Annual pilot farmer conferences</li>
<li>Nutrition training for 66,500 students</li>
<li>Development of at least three demonstration sites in every targeted region, and at least two model demonstration permaculture farms</li>
<li>PACA-based food security plans in 200 villages.</li></ul></p>

<h3>Food Security Grants</h3>

<p>Some of the PAPA funds are available as grants to go toward volunteer projects that advance the <a href="index.html">Food Security</a> goals. PC Senegal volunteers can apply for a Food Security grant like they would other SPA funds. Volunteers may request up to $5,000 for Community Development, up to $1,000 for a Training Activity, and up to $500 for a Technical Exchange. Also, like SPA grants, a community cash contribution that covers 10 percent of the total cost and in-kind contribution to cover 15 percent of the total cost are still required.</p>
