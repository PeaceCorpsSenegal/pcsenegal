<H1 align="center">Food Security</H1><h2 align="center">Nutrition</h2>

<table><tr><td><p>In Senegal, 26 percent of the population is undernourished and chronic malnutrition levels are particularly high among children under five. Improved nutrition involves better access to healthy food and intentionally utilizing what's available. Volunteers work toward sustainable nutrition development through education, diet adjustment, and organized community ation plans.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>
<p><a href="../images/schoolg_emilie_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/schoolg_emilie_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /> </a> Volunteers educate their communities about nutrition in a variety of settings: through training sessions with health posts, presentations at womens group meetings, prominent mural projects, and informal conversations with farmers and gardeners.</p>
<p>Volunteers work with schools to incorporate nutrition into lesson plans and to build new learning models for nutrition information.</p>
<p>School gardens provide both a visual and tactile tool for nutrtion education.</p><p> <a href="gardens.html">School garden resources, lesson plans, and case studies</a></p>
<p> Through the Food Security Initiative, volunteers will educate 66,500 students about nutrtion over the next four years.</p>


<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>In addition to producing more food, improved diet involves better utilization of the nutritious food already available. PCVs promote a number of fortified foods that call upon local plants and resources.</p>

<p>Moringa olifera is a tree whose leaves are lauded for high vitamin and mineral content. Known locally as "nebedie," the tree thrives even in harsh environmental conditions and relies on little water. Volunteers promote planting moringa in intensive beds, as alleycropping, and in gardens or family compounds. </p>

<p>The leaves pack a lot of nutrition either cooked or dried and pounded into a powder supplement. For a child aged 1-3, a 100g serving of fresh cooked moringa leaves provides all of her daily requirement of calcium, 75 percent of her iron, half her protein, all essential amino acids, and important amounts of potassium, B vitamins, copper. Just 20g provide a child with all of the vitamins A and C she needs.</p>

<h3>PACA Planning</h3>
<p> The sustainable success of the food security initiative requires a new perspective and long term planning from local communities. Peace Corps Senegal aims to facilitate community-based, five year action plans in 200 villages with the Food Security Initiative.</p>

<p>The PACA process takes measures to include the voices of men, women, boys, and girls. Together, the community identifies food security needs and the feasability and priority for meeting those needs. Various villages might decide to work toward a new well and community garden fence, a new seed storage facility, or to organize technical skill trainings for local growers.</p>
