<h4>Moringa</h4>
<p>Between July 7th-12th 33 volunteers and their counterparts participated in a moringa oleifera tournee throughout 22 communities in the three PC sub-regions of Kaolack (Kaolack, Fatick, and Kaffrine). The tournee was the first of two parts of their region-wide initiative to teach the agricultural and nutritional importance of moringa. Volunteers focused their teaching on agricultural techniques, and the difference between intensive and standard cultivation.  Each site received a 1x3 meter intensive bed and seeded three trees for a future seed source.  10,000 seeds were planted during the six-day training and in total, 264 women, 93 men, and 249 children were trained.</p>

<h4>Gardens</h4>
<p>PCV Richard Ross began a program in Saint Louis teaching local Talibe gardening skills with a curriculum he designed.  9 boys ages 11-14 from three local Daaras meet twice a week spending the first half hour learning techniques and the last hour putting them to practice.
