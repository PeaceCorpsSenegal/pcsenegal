Major problems faced by the region's 30 volunteers include food security, malaria, and deforestation.  The current active sectors of Dakar region include Small Enterprise Development, Environmental Education, Health, Urban Agriculture, Sustainable Rural Agriculture and Ecotourism.
</p>

<p><b>Small Enterprise Development</b><br />
The city of Thiès and its surrounding towns are one of the most populated areas in Senegal.  SED volunteers help local businesses and artisans, both inside urban areas and in surrounding villages, more effectively manage their resources and market their products.  Dakar region SED volunteers have made great strides in helping local artisans develop connections with buyers outside of Senegal.</p>

<p><b>Health</b><br />
Dakar region health volunteers work on a variety of projects inluding bed net distributions, training health relays, and water purification.  Health volunteers are key players in local communities working with health posts and hospitals.<br />
</p>

<p><b>Urban Agriculture</b><br />
The large urban centers of Dakar region are an ideal place for rooftop, hospital, and school gardens.  Urban Ag volunteers help communities develop these spaces to contribute to nutrition as well as income generation.  Peace Corps Senegal has had a long term successful project running a hospital garden in the capital that provides much needed nourishment for people living with HIV/AIDS. <br />

</p>

<p><b>Ecotourism</b><br />
The beautiful beaches of the Petite-Côte are a haven for European tourists.  Ecotourism volunteers work with local people to help them better understand the needs of tourists as well as developing strategies to insure sustainable and fair tourism.  
</p>

<p><b>Sustainable Rural Agriculture</b><br />
Dakar region suffers from desertification due to long term deforestation.  On top of this there are a number of other issues that make farming here quite difficult.  Agriculture volunteers help introduce techniques such as live fencing and mixed crop planting to make the most of the fragile soil.  
</p>

<p><b>Environmental Education</b><br />
Environmental Education volunteers have been doing a variety of different projects throughout the Dakar region.  Some of their recent work has included latrine projects, community basketball courts, and school gardens.  
EE volunteers focus on a more wholistic approach to community development and often collaborate with volunteers from different sectors.
