<H1>Northern Senegal</H1><br />

<p><a class="gallery" href="regions/north/photos/North_01_700.jpg"><img src="regions/north/photos/North_01_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a> The long arid region that runs along the Senegal River, consisting of Saint-Louis and Matam,  is home to some of the most remotely placed volunteers in the country.  On top of its physical isolation northern Senegal is also culturally isolated with the majority of the population consisting of the Pulaar ethnic group.  The 20 volunteers who make their home in this challenging region must regularly deal with some of the hottest temperatures in west Africa and the lowest rainfall in Senegal. These conditions make the Senegal River the lifeblood of the region.  The current active sectors include, Urban Agriculture, Small Enterprise Development, Environmental Education, and Health.</p>


<p><b>Small Enterprise Development</b><br />
SED volunteers in Northern Senegal work with women's groups as well as with local business owners.  They set up trainings in topics such as accounting and marketing as well as doing consulting.  <br />

<p><b>Health</b><br />
The conservative culture of Northern Senegal poses unique problems for health workers.  It is often difficult to talk about taboo subjects despite their importance.  Health volunteers use their local language skills and cultural understanding to help educate people about the importance of pre-natal care, AIDS testing, and other difficult subjects.<br />

<p><b>Urban Agriculture</b><br />
Being the most arid region in Senegal the North represents many difficulties and unique opportunities for volunteers.  One of these opportunities is urban gardening.  The isolation of much of the North makes it difficult for towns and village to receive fresh fruits and vegetables.  Through rooftop and school gardens volunteers are able to show people how to grow their owns fruits and vegetables.  Such projects are key in solving problems related to malnutrition.

<p><b>Environmental Education</b><br />
The dryness of Northern Senegal makes for a fragile ecosystem.  EE volunteers help to sensitize local people to the importance of maintaining healthy natural ecosystems.  Projects include well covers, waste management, and school gardens.
