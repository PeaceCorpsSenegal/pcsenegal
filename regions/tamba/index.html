Covering this large expanse is a wide mix of ethnic groups.  Pulaars, Jaxanke, Mandinka, Bambara, as well as Wolof make their home here.  Volunteers must have excellent language and cultural skills to do well in this remote, yet diverse, region.  </p>


<p><b>Small Enterprise Development</b><br />
Tambacounda is a regional capital marked by the intersection of routes to Mali, Guinea, Dakar, the Gambia and the Casamance. Recent road renovations between Tamba and Dakar have brought an influx of goods to the area and increased commercial activity.<br />

The city boasts an organized network of women’s groups involved in microcredit and small business. SED volunteers work with local entrepreneurs and women’s groups on business planning and accounting. Cross-sector collaboration between SED PCVs and those in outlying villages includes organizational training for women’s groups and accounting training for a community health post. <br />

<p><b>Health</b><br />
In Tambacounda, health volunteers focus on malaria prevention through mosquito net distribution, improving access to clean sanitation facilities through projects such as latrine construction, formal and informal education of HIV/AIDS, family planning, condom distributions and reproductive education, as well as health infrastructure development such as increased training for local health workers, facility construction and maintenance, baby weighing, vaccinations, and nutrition education.</p>

<p><b>Urban and Peri-Urban Agriculture</b><br />
Urban and Peri-Urban Agriculture volunteers work in a variety of ways to promote urban food security. Tasks include Organic Gardening information extension, the introduction and distribution of ornamentals, and the extension of improved poultry stock. Current projects include the installation of an ecological garden demonstration and community classes on composting and organic fertilization methods. Volunteers, in partnership with the Tamba Department of Agriculture, work with local market gardeners and women's organizations.

<p><b>Agroforestry</b><br />
Agroforestry volunteers in Tambacounda partner with Wula Nafaa (a USAID-funded organization), Eaux et Forêts (the local forest service), community schools, women's groups, and farmers throughout the region. Charcoal production, the effects of migrant herders, collection of firewood, and forest fires make deforestation an ever-increasing challenge. Therefore, volunteers promote agroforestry technologies such as windbreaks, firebreaks, community plantings, orchard plantings, alley cropping, and live fencing within their communities. A partnership between Peace Corps and USAID developed the Food Security Initiative as a sustainable way to promote the adoption of agroforestry technologies by qualified local farmers. In the future, these innovative farmers will serve as resources for their communities

<p><b>Sustainable Rural Agriculture</b><br />
Sustainable Agriculture volunteers in the Tamba region work with villages towards the primary goal of improving rural food security by increasing agricultural yields and incomes, while encouraging environmental conservation. Volunteers are currently working to implement community and school gardens using permagarden techniques, which make efficient use of rainwater and maximize vegetable production.  During the rainy season, volunteers work with farmers to extend improved seed for corn, millet, sorghum, rice, cowpeas and sesame, and encourage the use of improved agricultural techniques that can increase yields, such as composting, proper plant spacing, timely weeding, and Integrated Pest Management.

<p><b>Environmental Education</b><br />
Environmental Education volunteers in the Tambacounda region work with local schools and health posts to sensitize communities on the importance of ecology and health. Volunteers team up with local nonprofit organizations and volunteers of different sectors to best address a variety of needs. Current projects include Community Content-Based Instruction (CCBI) in the schools, community and school gardens, after-school programming, composting, latrines, tree nurseries, radio programming, gender and development programming, creating natural mosquito repellent (using Neem tree leaves), well covers, and a “healthy baby contest.”
