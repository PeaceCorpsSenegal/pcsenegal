<p><a class="gallery" href="regions/kolda/photos/Kolda_01_700.jpg"><img src="regions/kolda/photos/Kolda_01_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a> Kolda lies beneath the Gambia in the forested south of Senegal.  Culturally unique and geographically isolated from the rest of Senegal it retains a unique flavor.  This isolation also comes with a price, Kolda suffers from the highest rate of maternal mortality in Senegal as well as issues with malnutrition and teen pregnancy. Kolda region has volunteers in the Health, Urban Agriculture, Sustainable Rural Agriculture, Agroforestry, and Environmental Education sectors.</p>


<p><b>Small Enterprise Development</b><br />
Located between the Gambia, Guinea, and Guinea-Bissau; Kolda is located on numerous trade routes for foreign goods.  This gives the markets of Kolda a unique feel and provides unique opportunities for local business people.  SED volunteers help bridge the gaps in resources and expertise in order to make local businesses more profitable.

<p><b>Health</b><br />
Kolda has some of the more acute issues with maternal mortality and teen pregnancy in Senegal. Volunteers help to transcend taboos while working with local people to insure that mothers get the proper pre and post natal care.  Cultural sensitivity and language ability are the cornerstones to the success of Kolda health volunteers.

<p><b>Urban Agriculture</b><br />
Despite a favorable climate for gardening few urban people in Kolda grow their own vegetables.  Urban Ag volunteers help demonstrate the benefits, both nutritionally and economically, of maintaining a rooftop or backyard garden.

<p><b>Agroforestry</b><br />
Agfo volunteers have worked especially hard on tree grafting trainings for mangoes. This has been instrumental in improving the mango crop of rural villagers.  Volunteers have also been fostering a relationship with Trees For the Future, a Washington-based NGO, by supporting its local liason.<br />

<p><b>Sustainable Rural Agriculture</b><br />
With some of the highest rainfall in Senegal Kolda should be an ideal place for farming.  Unfortunately, changing soil conditions have proven difficult for local farmers to adapt to.  Agriculture volunteers help introduce new techniques and strategies to increase yields.  <br />

<p><b>Environmental Education</b><br />
Kolda EE volunteers work with a variety of local organizations, including schools and health posts.  Their projects include school gardens, well covers, and water treatment.
