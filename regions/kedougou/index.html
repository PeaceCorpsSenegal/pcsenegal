This beauty belies a number of problems that persist throughout the mountainous and wet terrain.  Malaria, HIV/AIDS, malnutrition, and maternal mortality are issues all volunteers must face here.  Current sectors include Small Enterprise Development, Health, Urban Agriculture, Ecotourism, Sustainable Rural Agriculture, Agroforestry, and Environmental Education</p>


<p><b>Small Enterprise Development</b><br />
Kedougou is a region rich in natural resources including gold, iron ore, and uranium.  There are a number mining operations currently extracting these precious resources.  SED volunteers have been working with local farmers to allow them to sell their produce to the mining companies who had previously been importing all of their goods from Dakar or overseas.

<p><b>Health</b><br />
Kedougou volunteers have been instrumental in operating several large-scale bed net distributions throughout the region. Volunteers have also been working with areas affected by HIV/AIDS due to the large influx of migrant labor from the mining operations.<br />

</ul></p>

<p><b>Urban Agriculture</b><br />

With only one urban center, Kedougou is one of the least densely populated regions in Senegal.  Kedougou city has seen a large population increase as rural people move to town for better opportunities.  Urban Agriculture volunteers help show people how they can grow and manage their own gardens to counter the dwindling regional food supplies.</p>

<p><b>Ecotourism</b><br />
Kedougou is one of the most picturesque regions in Senegal, but its isolation provides many difficulties for tourism.  Ecotourism volunteers help to develop contacts with agencies in Dakar as well as using online media to better market this beautiful but isolated region.<br />

</p>

<p><b>Agroforestry</b><br />
Agfo volunteers have worked especially hard on tree grafting trainings for mangoes. This has been instrumental in improving the mango crop of rural villagers.  Volunteers have also been fostering a relationship with Trees For the Future, a Washington-based NGO, by supporting its local liason.<br>

</p>

<p><b>Sustainable Rural Agriculture</b><br />
Agriculture volunteers have been making great strides in introducing new crops, such as sesame seeds, to areas that have traditionally had very little crop diversity.  Ag volunteers have also been working with women's group gardens to bring vegetables to rural villages.

<p><b>Environmental Education</b><br />
Environmental Education volunteers work as extension agents with local schools and health posts to aid in trainings and sensitizations.  Current projects include the introduction of a simple locally produceable nut shelling machine.
