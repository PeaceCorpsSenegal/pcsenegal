The region hosts a wide variety of ecosystems including the rich Gambia River delta.  Volunteers face any number of issues including deforestation, pollution, soil degredation, malaria, and malnutrition. Kaolack is growing quickly and volunteers here are involved in projects that address some of the most pressing development concerns.</p>


<p><b>Small Enterprise Development</b><br />
Building on Kaolack's rich agriculture heritage, SED volunteers help add value to produce by aiding entrepreneurs in transforming raw goods into market-ready products. Volunteers also work with local businesses to help them market themselves in a quickly growing region.</p>

<p><b>Ecotourism</b><br />
Ecotourism volunteers in Kaolack region help to develop the business skills of local tourism destinations.  The beautiful Sine-Saloum delta is a haven for adventurous travelers, but often lacks basic facilities.  Ecotourism volunteers help bridge this gap in a sustainable way.</p>

<p><b>Sustainable Rural Agriculture</b><br />
The Kaolack region has been the peanut heartland since colonial times.  However, due to desertification and drought many farmers have fallen on hard times.  Ag volunteers help to introduce new crops and new techniques to insure regional food security.<br />

<p><b>Agroforestry</b><br />
Though much of the Senegalese population is involved in agriculture, agroforestry remains a relatively unused concept.  Agfo volunteers demonstrate how trees can be used to protect crops, provide respite from intense heat, and provide nourishment for hungry children.<br />
