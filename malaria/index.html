<h1>PC Senegal &amp; Malaria</h1>

<p><a href="photos/andrew2.jpg" class="gallery" title="Photo courtesy of Andrew Oberstadt"><img src="photos/thumbs/andrew2_thumb.jpg" class="floatleft"></a>Peace Corps Volunteers in all regions of Senegal are leading efforts to prevent malaria, one of the the primary causes of child mortality in the country. Volunteers are providing malaria prevention education and have led insecticide-treated mosquito bed net distribution campaigns that have become a model for NGOs and governments all across Africa. These efforts have led to the first large-scale universal bed net distribution in the history of Senegal, which by the middle of 2011 had succeeded in covering 7 of the country's 14 regions, including all the areas where the disease is most prevalent.</p>

<p><a href="photos/andrew4.jpg" class="gallery" title="Photo courtesy of Andrew Oberstadt"><img src="photos/thumbs/andrew4_thumb.jpg" class="floatright"></a>Nearly three-quarters of a million children a year die of malaria, and nearly 90% of those children are in sub-Saharan Africa. Pregnant mothers also bear an important part of the malaria burden, as malaria-induced anemia can be fatal during childbirth. Even beyond these two vulnerable groups, malaria is a tremendous drag on health and productivity for the entire Senegalese society.</p>

<p><a href="photos/olivia4.jpg" class="gallery" title="Photo courtesy of Andrew Oberstadt"><img src="photos/thumbs/olivia4_thumb.jpg" class="floatleft"></a>Peace Corps Senegal is working to combat malaria by partnering with several key organizations, including the government's National Malaria Control Program, USAID and the President's Malaria Initiative, NetWorks, Malaria No More, Against Malaria, and others. Our shared vision is a long-lasting insecticide-treated net over every bed in Senegal, with broadly available malaria prevention and treatment seeking education. Studies shows that this universal coverage technique is much more effective in reducing the endemic nature of malaria than piecemeal solutions. Our shared aim is to cut off the supply of infected blood to mosquitoes, eliminating their ability to keep spreading the disease. With mosquito net distributions and other interventions, we get closer to that goal every day.</p>

<p>In 2009 and 2010, as a result of the efforts of Peace Corps Volunteers and their partners, an entire Health District in Senegal (Saraya, in the southeastern region of Kedougou) received comprehensive malaria prevention education and universal bed net coverage. For the first time in the history of Senegal, every man, woman and child in this health district was sleeping safely under a mosquito net. Critics who had been arguing that universal coverage was too costly and complicated to implement were silenced.</p>

<p><a href="photos/andrew5.jpg" class="gallery" title="Photo courtesy of Andrew Oberstadt"><img src="photos/thumbs/andrew5_thumb.jpg" class="floatleft"></a>Following the success of the Saraya campaign, Peace Corps Senegal partnered in 2010 with the government of Senegal, Malaria No More, Tostan and World Vision to provide universal coverage and malaria education in the District of Velingara, located in the south-central region of the country. The effort in Velingara, which is home to five times the population of Saraya, demonstrated that these distribution and education methodologies could be scaled up and replicated effectively.</p>

<p><a href="photos/garrison3.jpg" class="gallery" title="Photo courtesy of Andrew Oberstadt"><img src="photos/thumbs/garrison3_thumb.jpg" class="floatright"></a>As 2010 and 2011 progressed, new partners adopted the Peace Corps method of universal coverage. Working in concert, the distribution moved north and west, covering every bed in every hut and home. The regions of Kedougou, Kolda, Sedhiou, Tambacounda, Kaolack, Kaffrine, Fatick and Diourbel were completely covered by August of 2011. Later in 2011 the project will move on to the northern regions of Senegal, then on to Ziguinchor, Thies and Dakar. Once the entire country is covered, the partners will turn to continuing projects of supply chain management and small-scale redistributions to ensure that treated mosquito nets are always available in local health posts and pharmacies, along with the ongoing challenge of ensuring that everyone who does become sick with malaria seeks and receives treatment quickly.</p>

<p><a href="photos/andrew2.jpg" class="gallery" title="Photo courtesy of Andrew Oberstadt"><img src="photos/thumbs/andrew2_thumb.jpg" class="floatleft"></a>Peace Corps Senegal Volunteers have been deeply integrated in these campaigns, and they will continue to bring their unique skills to bear on malaria prevention and education projects across the country. Volunteers are focused on using their local language skills and deep cultural integration to conduct effective education activities, to help ensure that delivered nets are used correctly, that treatment is quickly sought for the ill, and to evaluate impact through post-distribution, compound-to-compound assessments.</p>

<p>As extensive as our work with bed nets is, Volunteers are also deeply engaged with other types of interventions. These include theater tours, neem lotion products, supply chain management and others. We assist many local partners with their particular malaria-related goals, including PATH/MACEPA's groundbreaking pre-elimination program in the Richard Toll district of Senegal.</p>

<p>The Stomping Out Malaria in Africa initiative was inspired by the work of Peace Corps/Senegal volunteers, who showed that malaria control programs can be scaled up and save lives all across a country. The cornerstone of the initiative is a partnership between Peace Corps and the President's Malaria Initiative, but the heart of it is in the 3,000 volunteers across 25 African countries, all now united by the goal of eradicating malaria.
