<H1>Peace Corps Response</H1>

<p>Peace Corps Response provides returned Peace Corps Volunteers the opportunity to serve again in rewarding, short-term assignments. Peace Corps Response Volunteers bring their skills and experience to projects in places where they are needed most. Peace Corps Senegal currently has three Peace Corps Response volunteers, serving in Thies and Dakar.</p>

<p>And now for a bit about...</p>

<p><a class="gallery" href="pcresponse/photos/arnold_bethany_700.jpg"><img src="pcresponse/photos/arnold_bethany_150.jpg" class="floatleft" /></a>Originally from Crystal Lake, IL (a suburb of Chicago), I studied International Studies/Development and French Translation at American University in Washington, DC. Upon graduation in May 2007, I stayed in DC for a while and worked for the NGO <a href="http://www.womenforwomen.org/" target="_blank">Women for Women International</a> and at a great independant coffeehouse. I shipped out for the Peace Corps in March 2008 to Senegal. I was assigned to a small village in the Sine Saloum River Delta as a Health Education Volunteer.  Some of my projects included a school garden and a women's community garden, a large-scale simple village latrine project, village health sensibilizations, neem lotion promotion, and lots of programs aimed at educating youth and keeping them in school, including a large middle school peer-educator Life Skills health training. I was also very involved in helping with Pre-Service Training for new Peace Corps Senegal trainees, including creating a new cross-culture handbook, and worked with fellow PCVs to write a Serere-English dictionary for Peace Corps use. After my Close of Service in May 2010, I spent 4 months in Illinois before heading off to France, where I spent 6 months working as an English Language Assistant at a high school in rural Burgundy before returning to Senegal as a Response Volunteer.</p>
 
<p>As a Response Volunteer I am based in Thies and work with the NGO <a href="http://plan-international.org/" target="_blank">Plan International</a>.  Plan already has a Youth Economic Empowerment (YEE) program that functions to empower at risk youth ages 15-25 (school dropouts) through small village savings and loans programs.  To supplement the financial lessons being taught, Plan wants to add a Life Skills component (good decision making, self confidence, gender equality, reproductive health, etc).  My job is to do a needs assessment of their program and youth, create a Life Skills curriculum based on that assessment, conduct a Training of Trainers in Life Skills, and work with the new PCV who will be assigned to Plan to continue and evaluate the program, among other things.  I arrived back in Senegal on March 10 and will be here until mid August when I return to the US to start graduate studies in public health. (If you give me a few weeks I'll know where I am going for sure.) Peace Corps and Senegal had a profound impact on my life and I am really glad to be back here!  I love to dance and laugh which makes Senegal a great place for me. :)</p>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/johnson_kerry_700.jpg"><img src="photos/headshots/johnson_kerry_200.jpg" class="floatleft" /></a>After college I entered the Peace Corps in 1965 and my training was at Southern University in Baton Rouge LA.  I served first in Guinea as a Photography teacher at a Fine Arts College in Conakry in 1965 and up to November 1966 when the Peace Corps was asked to leave Guinea.  I actually spent a month in Dakar upon leaving Guinea and we were given the option of doing one more year in the Peace Corps so I decided to do another year in Niger.  I was the head of the movie department in a UN funded project to support a nation wide literacy project.  I worked in Niamey between January 1967 and January 1968.  I went to France for almost a year and worked for a French advertising company and took University classes.  Upon returning back to California I started teaching high school social studies classes from 1969 to 1976 when I switched to teaching what was a new subject in those days computer science.  I taught high school computer science classes and also was a career counselor between 1976 until 1985 when I became a school administrator.  I was a California public school administrator with the title Director of Information Services, basically the people that worked in my department were responsible for computers, networks, and telecommunications and retired from this role in 2006.  I spent another year doing consulting in computers after retirement and then got to spend quality time hiking, backpacking, and camping mostly in Western US national parks.</p>
 
<p>I found out about the Response Volunteer program and started checking out the possibilities about two years ago.  I applied for a University teaching position in Guinea, was accepted and went to Guinea in August of 2010.  Due to the political situation in Guinea the volunteers were not allowed to go to our sites so I was in the town where Peace Corps training is held in Guinea, Dubreka until January 2011 when I had the opportunity to come to Senegal as a response volunteer.</p>
 
<p>Here in Senegal I live in Thies.  I am working to prepare teaching materials.  Including lesson plans and making modifications to the Junior Achievement courses for primary and secondary schools.  The materials need to be adapted to better fit the culture and situation in Senegal.  I am also teaching the secondary class at the Lycee Technique in Thies.</p>
 
<p>The majority of my time is spend writing teacher and student materials, mostly in French, however, I am translating many of the materials into English to help the volunteers.  I am also working on course materials to teach the new volunteers arriving in country starting in June of 2011.<p>
 
<p>I am very fortunate here in Senegal.  My living conditions are very nice.  The people I am in contact with are excellent.  I am having a great time.</p>
 
<p>My COS is August 17th, 2011 and I will be meeting family members in Paris for a couple of weeks on my way back to California.</p>
 
<p>I may even check the Peace Corps Response site from time to time to see if there is a job that I could do.</p>
