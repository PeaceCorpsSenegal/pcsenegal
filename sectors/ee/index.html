<H1>Environmental Education</H1>

<p>Senegal has six ecological zones ranging from forest to desert. The natural resources found across the country are abundant, and the land is beautiful, making it a well-known tourist destination. However, because of a rather large jump in demographic growth and particularly difficult socio-economic context, the country’s bank of natural resources in quickly diminishing. Senegal has been subject to alarming levels of exploitation.  Overfishing, deforestation and desertification, as well as dramatically rising levels of pollution are just a few of the problems that have led to increased health issues and a declined quality of life. The Environmental Education program in Senegal aims to teach community members, service providers and school children environmental awareness in order to facilitate a change of behavior towards the utilization and protection of natural resources.</p>
<h3>What We Do</h3>
<p>Environmental Education across the world is a process of recognizing values in order to develop the skills necessary to understand and appreciate the inter-relationship between a person and his surroundings. At the village level it is important for volunteers to study the environmental values of their community in order to facilitate appropriate environmental education. Volunteers begin their service by performing evaluations in a two-fold manner: the community and the local school. This enables the volunteer to correctly determine the specific environmental issues in their rural sites. Once the surveys are completed, the volunteer and the community share in creating an environmental action plan, strategized specificly to combat the village’s main environmental problems. As part of this two-fold strategy, school children are targeted through classroom lessons and environmental training in a community content-based format. Environmental Education clubs are also formed to help children gain awareness of their environment through activities and games outside of the classroom. At the community level, non-formal education techniques are used as well as concrete actions like tree planting, waste management projects, and latrine construction.</p> 
<h3>Achievements</h3> 
<p><b>Reforestation Efforts</b> <br />
Over the last year, Environmental Education Volunteers out planted over 10,000 trees across the country. In a land that is constantly aware of the encroaching desert, these trees, in many varieties, will serve as a nutritional aid, barriers to desertification, relief from the sun, as well as to support the material needs for lumber, charcoal and firewood.</p>
<p><b>Teacher Training</b> <br />
In the last year, 300 teachers were able to participate in formal training classes in Community Content Based Instruction (CCBI). CCBI lessons integrate environmental concepts into the French-based curriculum’s general subject areas (i.e. math, science and grammar). These activities specifically target the community’s local environmental problems. CCBI lessons not only introduce teachers and students to environmental awareness, they also tend to be more dynamic, and create student interactions and involvement that do not normally take place in the lecture-based classrooms of Senegal.</p>
<p><b>School Gardens</b> <br />
School gardens have become an important part of an Environmental Education Volunteer’s work.  These gardens are taken care of by the children, and serve as a training ground for various classroom lessons. The gardens are then able to add to the nutrition of the student’s diet, raise money for various projects though selling the garden’s harvest and can even serve in teaching core values to the school children, such as responsibly, and diligence in work.</p>
