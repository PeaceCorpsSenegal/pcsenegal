<p><a class="gallery" href="sectors/agfo/photos/agfo_07_700.jpg"><img src="sectors/agfo/photos/agfo_07_300.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a>Senegal is one of the more stable countries in Africa.  However, it still has significant food insecurity issues due to poverty and over population.  According the World Food Program, 50% of Senegalese households are affected by poverty and spend 48% of their income on food. Malnutrition levels especially in children are consistently high due to lack of nutritional food, education, and sanitary conditions.</p>
<p>Furthermore the deforestation in sub Saharan West Africa is occurring at an alarming rate.  Millions of people cook their food everyday with wood taken from the rapidly depleting forest land close to their villages. People in cities will buy large bags of charcoal, which many times, has been harvested illegally from national forests. The soils on current agricultural land are being completely drained of nutrients and organic matter, making the soil infertile and susceptible to major erosion problems.</p> 
<p>Agroforestry, simply defined is the use/combination of trees an agriculture crops on the same land.  This symbiotic relationship helps to increase yields by protecting the crops from the harsh winds, the destructive properties of the sun, and grazing livestock.  Trees also provide much needed nutrients and organic matter to the exhausted soils.  More organic matter in the soil means less wind and water erosion problems.  Trees also provide fruit and wood which farmers can use eat or sell in the market to supplement their agriculture profits. </p>

<h3>What We Do</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" title="Ian Freeburg climbs a tree" href="sectors/agfo/photos/agfo_03_700.jpg"><img src="sectors/agfo/photos/agfo_03_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" /></a>Agroforestry is a key player in the fight against hunger, poverty and disease and deforestation.  The volunteers in Senegal use direct and indirect methods to implement agroforestry techniques at the grassroots level. PCV’s accomplish this be focusing on the social, economic, and environmental elements of these problems.</p>     
<p>Agroforestry volunteers don’t just plant trees. While this is the primary way to effectively slow desertification, PCV’s also complete secondary projects that indirectly help combat the deforestation, poverty, malnutrition, and lack of education problems.  Some of the projects include:</p>   

<p><b>Farmer Trainings</b><br />
Volunteers will often collaborate on region wide projects. PCV’s will host a group of farmers from around their region and train them on topics such as grafting, proper agroforestry techniques, and orchard and tree nursery management.</p>   

<p><b>Collaborattion with NGO’s</b><br />
Some volunteers partner with NGO’s working in their areas to increase the effectiveness of the NGO and to help fund the volunteer’s projects.</p>  

<p><b>Manuals</b><br />
Some volunteers have taken it upon themselves to write manuals in English and the various native languages, along with easy to follow pictures to further aid in the training of Senegalese farmers.</p>

<p><b>Moringa initiative</b>
All volunteers in Senegal are urged to help plant Moringa oleifera, an extremely beneficial tree, to be used to combat malnutrition especially in children. Agroforestry volunteers lead the volunteers in other sectors in helping them to plant, collect seed and effectively grow this tree.</p>  

<p><b>Gardens</b><br />
Women’s Groups- Many villages have groups of women who will maintain a community garden.  Volunteers often help these women with the purchase of materials, and train them on proper gardening techniques and how to incorporate trees.</p>

Increasingly, schools in rural areas ask volunteers to help them construct and maintain school gardens.  The volunteers use this opportunity to instruct the students on how to care for trees and crops, as well as the benefits of trees and desertification awareness.</p>

<p><b>Mangrove Regeneration Project</b> <br />
Mangrove forests in the Fatick/Kaolack regions are being destroyed by human activities and a change in the concentrations of various salts and minerals in the waters there.  Volunteers have been working to reforest the area by planting mangrove cuttings.</p>
 
<p><b>Appropriate Technologies</b> 
Recently there has been a shift to promoting the use of inexpensive and easy to build/use technologies to help improve the quality of life of the villagers the agroforestry volunteers live with.</p>   

<p><b>Demo fields</b> <br />
Most volunteers will help a farmer create a demonstration plot with the implementation of multiple agroforestry techniques for the purpose of showing the other farmers in the village that agroforestry is a great tool to increase their quality of life.</p> 

<p><b>Creating Orchards</b> <br />
The production of mangos, cashews and citrus are a major business in Senegal.  Volunteers often aid and advise farmers in the establishment and management or fruit tree orchards.</p>


<h3>Achievements</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="sectors/agfo/photos/agfo_04_700.jpg"><img src="sectors/agfo/photos/agfo_04_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a>In the past 6 years, over sixty Agroforestry Volunteers sensitized and trained over 3500 farmers in Agroforestry technologies and fruit tree propagation in at least 150 villages, in the Fatick, Thies, Kaolack, Tamba, Kedougou and Kolda regions.</p>

<p>Agroforestry Volunteers have formed youth groups to construct tree nurseries at local primary schools, to be maintained by the students.  In addition to practical tree nursery construction, these groups have taught over 1000 students about conservation and the value of trees to their local environment.</p>

<p>Mango grafting training sessions have become a focus of some PC/Senegal Agroforestry volunteers, as well as volunteers from other secotrs. Using Small Projects Assistance funding support, they are utilizing the knowledge of both Peace Corps staff members and local experts to trained Senegalese farmers in mango grafting techniques. So far, over eighty farmers have been trained, with many more workshops to come this year.</p>
