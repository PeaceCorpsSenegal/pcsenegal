<p><a class="gallery" href="sectors/sed/photos/sed_maggieporridge_700.jpg"><img src="sectors/sed/photos/sed_maggieporridge_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a>Most individual entrepreneurs and groups in Senegal have few of the organizational and management skills necessary to start up or manage businesses effectively. Few currently have access to training or financial services. Some organizations are providing various forms of assistance to small businesses, but there is a huge unmet need for business planning, financial management, record keeping and marketing training. Many resources exist in Senegal and economic opportunities are increasing, especially with recent advances in information technology and the expansion of microfinance services. Unfortunately, due to lack of communication and networks to share market information and resources, potential business partnerships are rarely forged.</p>



<h3>What We Do</h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="sectors/sed/photos/sed_syrup_700.jpg"><img src="sectors/sed/photos/sed_syrup_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" /></a>SED PCVs do outstanding work as business counselors, trainers, and facilitators for individuals, associations, and small companies throughout Senegal. They work to build capacity in three basic areas: 1) They help groups and entrepreneurs improve their organizational and business management skills; 2) They facilitate linkages between entrepreneurs, associations, and small companies on the one hand and markets and outside sources of information/training and financial resources on the other; 3) They transfer knowledge related to entrepreneurship, basic business skills, and IT to young people and women.</p>
<p>The work of SED Volunteers supports the government of Senegal’s accelerated growth strategy, which focuses on encouraging private sector-led growth and expanding and diversifying exports. Some SED Volunteers are working in villages around national parks and protected areas to support communities interested in developing ecotourism products and services. These efforts support the government’s strategy of diversifying the tourism market and helping communities generate revenue from tourism for local development and conservation activities. SED PCVs act as facilitators of a process in which Senegalese entrepreneurs, associations, and young people learn to recognize and take advantage of the business opportunities and resources that exist in their communities, thereby helping them improve their standard of living and create employment opportunities. A new six-year project plan was initiated in January 2008. </p>

<p><b>Ecotourism</b></p>
<p>In partnership with the Direction des Parcs Nationaux, certain SED Volunteers are placed in villages around national parks and protected areas to support communities interested in developing ecotourism products and services. Tourism is the fastest growing sector of the Senegalese economy, but few Senegalese benefit from revenues generated from tourism activities. The government of Senegal believes ecotourism can help diversify the tourism market and funnel more revenues to communities for local development and conservation activities.</p>
