The shoemakers from the small town of 20,000 people have won Senegal’s Grand Prize for artisanal products an impressive three times since the award’s inception in 1993. Perhaps the best of these shoemakers is the family business called CAWAAN Cordonnerie.</p>

<p><img src="sectors/sed/artisan/photos/pete_cawaan_200.jpg" id="floatright" />Since the 1930s, CAWAAN Cordonnerie has made beautiful leather products. In 1980, Moussa Gueye took over leadership of the workshop along with his brothers, and they continue to put precision and care into each of their hand-made products. Only the best quality artisanal passport wallets, belts, bags, and sandals are made by the workshop.</p><p>Purchasing from CAWAAN represents an important investment in its Senegalese community. From the herders to the skin collectors to the tanners to the workshop, hundreds of people benefit directly from your purchase.</p>
