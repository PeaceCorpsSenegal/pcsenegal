<p><img class="inline" src="img/new.png" height="14px" /><b><u><a href="?page=sectors/sed/artisan/and_suxali.html">Thiouroukh Basket Association</a></u></b></b>
Thiouroukh's traditional baskets have been made in a small collection of Senegalese villages for decades. Long grass fibers were originally woven with strips of palm fronds into baskets and trays which served a range of purposes for the local people- from sifting grain to carrying luggage. Colorful plastic was introduced to brighten the utilitarian baskets into beautiful artisanal products, which have since caught on with locals and tourists alike throughout Senegal.</p>

<p><b><u><a href="index.php?page=sectors/sed/artisan/cawaan.html">CAWAAN (Leather – Ngaye Mekhe)</a></u></b><br />
Ngaye Mékhé is known throughout the country for its beautiful leather products. The
shoemakers from this small town of 20,000 have won Senegal’s Grand Prize for artisanal
products three times since the award’s inception in 1993. Perhaps the most renowned of
Ngaye’s shoemakers is a small family owned business called CAWAAN.</p>
<p>Since the 1930’s, CAWAAN has been handcrafting shoes and accessories from the finest
leather. Moussa Gueye and his brothers took over leadership in the 1980’s. Now in its third
generation, precision, quality, and a demand for excellence is visible in each handmade product.
Supporting the CAWAAN Cordonnerie represents an important investment in the Senegalese
community. From the herders to the tanners to the leather workers, dozens of people benefit
directly from your purchase.</p>


<p><b><u>Demba Mbow (Leather Goods - Mboro)</u></b><br />
For over 24 years Demba Mbow has crafted fine leather works of art for the people of

him to finish high school, Demba threw himself into his trade learning all there is to know about
leathers and skins. He started with the shoes on the feet of his family, then the village, and before
long Demba became known as the premiere leather worker of the coastal villages. A master of
the craft, and eager to recreate the latest fashions, he is always looking to expand his horizons.
Whether you’re looking for fine leather or reptile products, Demba’s boutique, Taibatoise, is the
