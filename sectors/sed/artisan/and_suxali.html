<h1>Thiouroukh, Advancing Our Community</h1>

Long grass fibers were originally woven with strips of palm fronds into baskets and trays which served a range of purposes for the local people- from sifting grain to carrying luggage. Colorful plastic was introduced to brighten the utilitarian baskets into beautiful artisanal products, which have since caught on with locals and tourists alike throughout Senegal.</p>

By bringing over 75 women from multiple villages together as a group, Thiouroukh is able to restore profits back to the artisans’ community, rather than to intermediaries who seek to drive down prices only to resell the products at a far higher price in tourist locations. Working for the Association means the women do not need to come to market to buy their materials or to sell their wares; they can stay at home and take care of their children while they weave, and they earn far more than they would working individually. The benefits of this arrangement are very meaningful to the women.</p>
