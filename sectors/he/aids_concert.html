<p><a href="images/Podor1_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/Podor1_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a>On the evening of January 31, 2009, the Peace Corps sponsored an AIDS Awareness Campaign in the town of Podor. The campaign consisted of a community education session, HIV/AIDS testing, a concert by 2 local bands, and a play by a local high school theater group. The event was held at the Catholic Mission, an outdoor venue on the Rue Nationale in Podor. The program schedule for the event is attached. Local partners include the Podor Health Center, Red Cross, Medicose del Mundo and the Catholic Mission.
The testing began at 9pm and went until about 12 :30 am. A total of 67 people were tested for HIV/AIDS, specifically 12 women and 55 men, with a result of 0 testing positive. Attendance count for the concert includes 366 men, 160 women, and 340 children (under 16) for a total of 866 attendees. Approximately 500 condoms were distributed, donated by Medicos del Mundo.</p>

<p>** For the month of January, the concert increased HIV/AIDS testing rates in Podor from 121 to 188.  Therefore, the concert resulted in a 55% increase in HIV/AIDS testing rates for the entire month of January. **</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p><a href="images/Podor2_700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/Podor2_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatright"/></a>Live music was performed by 2 local bands : the singer Baba Gangue and his group Lew-Lewal Fuuta and Fugaru Evolution, a reggae band from Ndioum. Through out the evening, the musicians and MC for the event encouraged the concert attendees to participate in the testing session. A local theater group conducted a skit telling the story of a couple who participates in risky behavior, therefore contracting and spreading the disease. The goal of the play was to educate community members about how HIV/AIDS is spread and what actions they should take to protect themselves. The community education session was conducted by Mr. Malick Deme, the Supervisor from the Podor Health Center. A large visual aid was painted and hung behind the stage, as a constant reminder of the HIV/AIDS prevention methods. The visual aid depicted a Senegalese man and woman holding hands with the words  ‘‘Abstinence Fidelité Dépistage Préservatives = Libres du SIDA’’ between them. A t-shirt design was created by a local teenage artist, with the same message of HIV/AIDS prevention methods written on the shirts.</p>

<h3>Promotion</h3>
<p>To promote the campaign, 200 color flyers were printed, distributed and posted in public locations through out Podor, such as boutiques, the post office, schools, the market, cyber cafes, restaurants, etc. We gave 80 invitations to community leaders, health workers, and youth workers. The ASCs (Associations Sportives et Culturelles) from each quartier were invited. The directors, teachers and student from the lycée, college, and private school were invited. Community members were encouraged to attend and were sensitized on the importance of participating in the testing session. A radio session promoting the event was conducted the afternoon before the concert. A banner advertising the event was painted by a local artist and hung on the Rue Nationale.</p>


<h3>Community Contribution</h3>
<p>The success of the concert was highly due to the participation of the community. Many community organizations and individuals came together to support and work towards the success of the event.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gendarmerie – 2 Gendarmes were sent to keep everything in order. One was at the door making sure nothing was stolen from the property. One was at the podium to ensure no one mounted who was not invited to and that the crowd remained in order.</li>
<li>Red Cross – 10 Red Cross volunteers came to assist with testing and counseling. They helped direct people where to go, monitor the waiting room, and act as security in the testing and counseling areas.</li>
<li>District Health Center – provided 100 chairs, provided car and driver (transportation), conducted sensibilisation</li>
<li>Medicose del Mundo – conducted testing and counseling, donated and distributed 500 condoms, helped with organization</li>
<li>Musicians – helped with organizing and promoting, encouraged the audience to participate in the free testing through out the concert, created the program and schedule for the evening, organized the MC and rappers</li>
<li>Local community artists – painted banner, painted t-shirt design</li>
<li>PCVs – a huge help, the concert could not have happened with out them, in charge of monitoring testing, counseling and waiting room. 2 were at the door encouraging every person who came in to do testing; 3 were at the waiting room, ushering people from counseling to testing, and distributing t-shirts to those who did the testing; 2 were at door counting how many men, women and children entered, as well as acting as security; 1 filmed. PCVs painted the massive visual aid that we hung behind the stage and the sign that said ‘Depistage’ used to clearly mark the testing center</li>
<li>Theater group- conducted skit on HIV/AIDS transmission and prevention</li>
<li>Local journalists – 2 local journalists, radio and print, covered the campaign</li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Problems encountered include that the initial acting group asked to conduct the play dropped out the day before the event. We therefore had to find and invite a different acting group to perform one day in advance. Secondly, a miscommunication concerning the rappers free services arose. It was agreed that the rappers would volunteer to perform for free, but after the concert, they claimed they were told they would be paid.
To prevent these problems in the future, one should create contracts for the musicians and actors to sign, in order to avoid discrepancies and to ensure they follow through with the work agreed upon.</p>

<h3>Successes</h3>
<p>The success of the event could be attributed to several factors.</p>
<ul>
<li>The concert was the idea of Baba Gangue, the local musician who performed at the event and a member of the Podor community. Therefore, Baba was willing to work hard towards the execution of a successful event. He cared about the success of the campaign</li>
<li>The work and collaboration of the community was a crucial aspect of the campaign’s success. Many community members came together to help organize, promote, and work at the event. All work was taken care of and conducted by community members. The Peace Corps was solely responsible for providing the financing and organization.</li>
<li>The extensive promotion of the event resulted in a large amount of community members attending and participating in the testing session</li>
<li>T-shirts were distributed as motivation for people to participate in the testing session.</li>
<li>Successful organizing by Peace Corps and Baba Gangue played a key role</li>
<li>Encouragement of the community to get tested by the Peace Corps, the musicians, the visual aids and event promotion was successful.</li>
<li>The concert and testing were conducted simultaneously during the evening, which attracted a large amount of community members, and provided cover for those who wished to remain unidentified when tested.</li>
</ul>

<p>All participants of the campaign, including attendees and partners, seemed very pleased with the execution of the event. The Health Center and Medicose del Mundo both stated that they had never had such a high number of people getting tested. Normally at events where testing is offered, there are only 20 people or less who participate in the testing session. For the month of January, the concert increased HIV/AIDS testing rates in Podor from 121 to 188.  Therefore, the concert resulted in a 55% increase in HIV/AIDS testing rates for the entire month of January. </p>
