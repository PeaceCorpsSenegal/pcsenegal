<p><a class="gallery" href="sectors/he/photos/health_nets_700.jpg"><img src="sectors/he/photos/health_nets_200.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" /></a>Malaria, child mortality, maternal death, malnutrition, diarrhoeal and sexual diseases (incl. AIDS) are the main medical health problems in Senegal. Though Senegal has improved its citizen’s health care dramatically in certain areas over the years, there is much more to be done. Consider the following, in Senegal:
<ul>
	<li>30 per cent of all child deaths are caused by malaria
(While only 7 per cent of children under 5 sleep under a treated mosquito net)</li>
	<li>Under-5 mortality rate (per 1000) is 116</li>
	<li>Of every 10,000 women who give birth to a child, 145 will die</li>
	<li>Almost one out of every five children under 5 is either moderately or severely malnourished</li>
	<li>Though low, roughly 0.8 percent, the HIV rate is increasing in Senegal</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Many health and nutritional programs in Senegal are hampered by insufficient funds, a shortage of trained personnel and a lack of effective presence in rural villages. The Health Program in Peace Corps Senegal has been a key player in supplementing and providing assistance in rural villages for decades via educational outreach programs, latrine and well construction, funding women’s leadership trainings, school gardens, radio theater and much more. Recently, through inter-agency communication and coordination, Peace Corps Health program has taken a seat at the national table concerning bed-net distribution, prevention and treatment of malaria. The Health program aims to improve the health conditions and the environmental settings of Senegalese communities in order to have a positive impact on their standard of living.</p>

The following are examples of activities that Health volunteers are currently engaged in:</p>
<p><b>Life Skills Workshops/Causeries</b><br /> Organize gatherings/conferences for young women and men to educate and improve communication skills, decision making, self-esteem, value of education, reproductive health, gender issues, STIs and HIV/AIDS, etc</p>

<p><b>Health Facility/School Lessons</b> <br />Create lesson plans to educate and make aware students and/or mothers concerning an array of health issues; including diarrhoeal diseases, maternal and infant heath, malaria, etc.</p>
<p><b>Participate in Vaccinations/Baby Weighings</b><br /> Communicate door to door to convince mothers that vaccinations and monthly baby weighings are crucial to their baby’s health.</p>
<p><b>Neem Lotion</b><br /> Working with women’s groups to make Neem mosquito repellent lotion using local resources.</p>
<p><b>Radio Theatre</b><br /> Create hour long ‘soap opera’ emissions (on average every two weeks) with health issues interwoven into the plot to target high volumes of Senegalese to listen and learn.</p>
<p><b>Latrine Construction</b><br /> Strategically constructing latrines in villages to encourage sanitary practices, reduce water contamination and the spread of diarrhoeal diseases.</p>
