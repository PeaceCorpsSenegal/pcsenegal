<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/ecolodge_2_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/ecolodge_2_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a>The Ségou Ecolodge Project established the first registered business in Ségou, created direct employment for a minimum of ten people, created indirect employment, and provides 15% of the profits directly to the community. For the ten people directly employed, the lodge is their primary source of income. Indirect employment opportunities are given to villagers producing local goods such as Fonio, Baobab power, Shea butter, and other goods. The portion of the profits given to the community are transferred under a robust accounting system to avoid confusion and conflicts. Ségou already has a functioning system set up to put communal profits from the cotton harvest to use for community projects and the profits from the lodge are simply added to that system.</p>

 

<p>With the help of a Small Projects Assistance grant from USAID and a strong community contribution three huts, public bathrooms, and the restaurant were completed during the second phase of the project. With fund raising through the <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=donate" target="_blank">Peace Corps Partnership Program</a>, the construction was completed. It consists of four round huts with interior bathrooms, a restaurant complete with a solar refrigerator, kitchen, public bathrooms, and a store room. The funding will also covered marketing and training activities to ensure the long term success and sustainability of the ecolodge. It is the hope of everyone involved in the project that the finished ecolodge serves as both an engine for development and environmental protection.</p>

 

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/ecolodge_3_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/ecolodge_3_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatright" /></a>Dindefello, the nearby town with a similar tourist attraction and a similar population has seen remarkable development in the last several decades. If Ségou is able to tap into the tourist market that is already passing through, it stands to reason that it will profit similarly in the years to come. While Ségou is located better geographically, Dindefello was chosen as the county seat in 2008 and despite sporting similar population sizes, the commercial activity in Dindefello is an order of magnitude larger than what occurs in Segou. Dindefello also attracts an order of magnitude larger of NGO interest. It cannot be said that the fact that Dindefello has had an established tourism infrastructure for the last twenty years has been the sole cause of these differences in development, but it has certainly been a factor. </p>
 

<p>In addition to financial returns, the ecolodge provides a number of environmental benefits. With only a few minor exceptions like hinges and the cement used to hold the mud bricks together all of the building and furniture materials have been and will be sourced locally. The management of the ecolodge understands the value of their environment and especially its value to their business. It also translates into action on the grounds of the ecolodge such as planting live fencing and replanting bamboo and raphia palm in the bush. These are two species that are still relatively abundant, but are facing increasing pressure. Making the waterfall profitable as an ecotourism destination encourages the village to conserve the ravine area, an important spot for local chimpanzees during the long dry season since the stream is spring fed.</p>
