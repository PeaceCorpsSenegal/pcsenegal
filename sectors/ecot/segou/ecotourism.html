Not only does it strive for a triple bottom line, but the owners committed to voluntarily following the Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria (GSTC). The GSTC are a conglomerate over 60 leading sustainable tourism and ecotourism sets of criteria and have the backing of the UN as well as many other leading organizations in the field.</p>


<p>“Ecotourism is a sector of tourism, based on nature travel and including the principles of sustainability. The International Ecotourism Society (TIES) defines ecotourism as: <b>“responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and improves the welfare of local people.”</b> Whatever definition is used, ecotourism should have a positive impact on both natural areas and the local community.</p>



<p>Tourism is an enormous and widespread industry. It is found all over the world, so its impacts, social, economic, and environmental, are also worldwide. These impacts can be positive, doing good, or negative, doing harm. Sustainable tourism usually aims to have minimal negative impacts, to minimize harm, and to optimize economic benefits. Ecotourism, a type of sustainable tourism, is usually conducted in largely untouched natural areas, which tend to be both environmentally and often socially sensitive (especially if local indigenous groups are involved), so its potential impacts can be even greater, for good or ill. Ecotourism aims to extend the positive impacts, through a special focus on conservation, benefits for host populations, and the education of visitors.</p>

 

<p>When we talk about “sustainable” activities, it usually means that we can do the activity in the same or similar way for the indefinite future (sustainable in time) in three main aspects:</p>

<p>• Environmentally – the activity minimizes any damage to the environment (flora, fauna, water, soils, energy use, contamination, etc.) and ideally tries to benefit the environment in a positive way (through protection and conservation).</p>

<p>• Socially and culturally – the activity does not harm, and may revitalize the social structure or culture of the community where it is located.</p>

<p>• Economic – the activity does not simply begin and then rapidly die because of bad business practices; it continues to contribute to the economic well-being of the local community. A sustainable business should benefit its owners, its employees, and its neighbors.</p>



<p>When we take these three aspects into account in our activities, this is called the “triple bottom line”. Sometimes it is referred to as “doing well by doing good.” It means running a business, an organization, or a government in such a way that it doesn’t destroy the resources – natural, cultural, or economic – on which it depends. In fact, a business that is run in this way can enhance all three aspects and continue to operate profitably, while benefiting its surrounding natural areas and communities.”</p>
