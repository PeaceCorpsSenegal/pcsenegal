<p>The second phase of the project was funded through the <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=donate" target="_blank">Peace Corps Partnership Program</a> (PCPP). The PCPP is a unique mechanism that allows friends and family from back home to contribute directly to a project that a PCV is working on. Rather than relying on a pool of funds from large international donors, foundations, or governments, the PCPP collects funds independently for each project. Additionally, since the PCVs are already in place, 100% of the funds collected go towards the project. </p>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/ecolodge_6_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/ecolodge_6_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a>As mentioned in the history section, the previous attempts at building a tourist lodge had failed largely due to a lack of sufficient initial investment. The huts were build out of split bamboo, which is cheap, but is not very appealing and does not last long. They were never able to take in enough money in the lifetime of the huts to afford to rebuild them every year or two. The goal of this project was to build structures permanent and comfortable enough that the ecolodge is able to earn more than enough money to cover depreciation costs. </p>

<p>The first phase of the project was funded with a Small Projects Assistance grant of $5,100 USD with a contribution from the community of $1,807 USD. In the second phase, the funding that was raised through the PCPP is $6,967 USD and the community contributed $2,571 USD. In total that is $16,445 USD. This is not a small sum of money for a village where subsistence is the norm and favors are exchanged more often than cash. However, it is the strong belief of the PCVs and local counterparts involved in the project that while the village could never provide the initial capital itself, the project is financially sustainable and will pay for itself in less than 10 years. Based off of the number of tourists already stopping in Ségou and the number that go to Dindefello, it has been projected that the ecolodge will make over $3,000 USD of profit in just the first two years of operation, some of which will go directly to the community and the rest will be reinvested in the ecolodge.</p>

<p>The implementation of the PCPP funding is fairly straight forward since it is simply a continuation of the already ongoing Ségou Ecolodge Project. Samalé, Ablaye, and Boubacar manage the construction while the PCV plays the role of a consultant, trainer, and guide. </p>

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/ecolodge_7_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/ecolodge_7_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatright" /></a>The community provided all of the unskilled labor for the project and covering all of the materials that can be obtained locally. The direct participants also contributed a well and storeroom that they had previously constructed near the site of the ecolodge with their own money. Since the ecolodge is two hours away from the waterfall by foot, many tourists prefer to travel as much of that distance as they can by car. Several years ago the village made a road half way out to the waterfall but it is badly in need of repair and so is the foot path that goes the rest of the distance. The community organized a work party to accomplish these tasks.</p>
