Upon finding a waterfall the trio called a village meeting and created a ten member bureau to pursue the idea of  creating a tourism lodge. For their first attempt they solicited the aid of the Peace Corps Volunteer (PCV) serving in Ségou at the time and built several very simple huts with flimsy bamboo walls half way between the waterfalls and the village, an hour from each. This attempt failed largely due to its obscurity and the difficulty of providing services that far away from the village. Their second attempt was closer to the village but suffered from being build on ground that flooded during the rainy season and from being under funded and under built just like the first attempt. The walls of the huts were made out of a woven split bamboo fencing and the floors were of plain dirt. This made the huts uncomfortable to stay in even for the most adventurous of tourists. It also made them highly susceptible to erosion and termite damage, a combination which repeatedly destroyed the huts, in one to two years, before enough money could be made off of them to reinvest. This prompted the bureau to continually seek outside funding just to rebuild what they previously had. Over the course of these failures, the originally cohesive ten member bureau fractured and finally broke up.</p>

 

<p>In 2008 Samalé, Ablaye, and Boubacar approached the PCV coordinator in Kedougou with the idea of creating a new more substantial lodge, something that would last for years and would meet the expectations of tourists. They specifically requested that the Peace Corps help them create and learn to manage the lodge rather than just help them find funding. They had grown weary from putting money into a failing lodge and wanted outside guidance. The coordinator and two other PCVs collaborated on an assessment of the previous failures and the possibilities that existed for success. The conclusion was that the lodges had failed not for a lack of motivation but for lack of resources. The trio of entrepreneurs had learned much from their mistakes and knew that financial assistance alone would not suffice, what they really needed was technical assistance. They were so adamant about this that they acknowledged and any further funding without technical assistance would be wasted. Fortunately, daily on the ground technical advice and guidance is exactly the sort of ashsistance PCVs are best suited for.</p>

 

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/ecolodge_5_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/ecolodge_5_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a>In June 2009 Ablaye attended the Peace Corps Project Design and Management training. With the skills he acquired at that training and the help of other locals and PCVs involved a project plan was put together. Rather than build yet another cheap lodge that would soon need to be replaced, it was decided to build cement and mud brick walls with a stone foundation for longevity and to guard against termites. The location was also changed to a higher piece of land and plans were put into place for erosion control. Based off of the experiences with the ten member bureau in Ségou and the community run lodge in Dindefello, that was also started with the help of a PCV, it was decided that the best model for the sustainability of the ecolodge was that Samalé, Ablaye, and Boubacar would own it with an obligation to share 15% of the profits with the community. This ensured the incentive to develop the business and the tenure of the managers to be able to do so, while at the same time preserving the rights of the community to have a stake in the venture.</p>

 

<p>In December 2009 a Small Projects Assistance grant was awarded for the first part of the construction of the new ecolodge. That funding was enough to cover three huts, toilets, and the roof of the restaurant. Samalé, Ablaye, and Boubacar worked tirelessly throughout the first six months of 2010 to get the construction completed before the rains came. Understanding that they would benefit from the ecolodge as well, community members showed up en masse for any task they were asked to assist with. The project has now been fully funded and completed.</p>
