<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/ecolodge_9_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/ecolodge_9_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a>By changing the model of the ecolodge from public to private, teaching better business practices, and constructing more durable buildings the project will become sustainable and succeed where other attempts at building a tourism lodge have failed. By making the ecolodge a private venture, there is much more incentive for the owners and managers to save for reinvestment and their long term tenure with the project is guaranteed. It will avoid the tragedy of the commons situation that happened in Segou and Dindefello with the community owned lodges.</p>

 

<p>No one currently living in Segou has finished high school and there is only one shop in town. Naturally, business skills are lacking. To overcome this, the direct participants were introduced to the concept of depreciation, long term financial planning, increased transparency of accounting, and created their own tailored accounting system. They also opened a bank account for the ecolodge. Additionally, they formally registered as a business with the government.</p>

 

<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/ecolodge_10_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/ecolodge_10_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatright" /></a>Termites and water did so much physical damage to previous attempts at a tourist lodge in Segou that they were not able to earn enough money to repair the lodge before it fell down. To overcome this problem, the location of the ecolodge was moved to a place that does not flood during the rainy season and the grounds was terraced to prevent erosion. The huts were built out of mud bricks instead of bamboo and the first half a meter of the walls are rock and cement to deter termites.</p>

 

<p>The project most certainly has the ability to be sustainable in the long term. The direct participants decided on a fixed percentage of 35% of the profits will go towards reinvestment. They also received training and aid on ways to make the ecolodge profitable beyond meals and nights. Moreover, the 15% of profits given to the community guarantee general support in a time of need. The direct participants are also concerned about the environmental durability and plan to offset all environmental impacts of the project.</p>
