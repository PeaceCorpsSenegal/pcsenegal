<p><a class="gallery" href="photos/ecolodge_8_700.jpg" ><img src="photos/thumbs/ecolodge_8_200.jpg" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a>Segou is a small village of about 1,000 people situated on the Guinea border in Southeastern Senegal. The village is 25 km from the regional capital of KÃ©dougou, nestled right at the foothills of the Guinea mountains. Segou hosts its own waterfall and ravine hike as a tourist attraction and is the last stopping point before Dindefello, an already established and thriving tourist destination with the same attractions. In addition to the waterfalls, the surrounding areas of both villages are inhabited by chimpanzees. Currently the Jane Goodall Institute of Spain, with funding from USAID/Wula Nafaa, is investigating the suitability of habituating the troupe in Dindefello as a means of conservation and a community run nature reserve is being planned.</p>
 

<p>While Segou is picturesque, it has benefited from the relatively abundant building materials of bamboo and stone to landscape and fence their compounds, its people live a subsistence lifestyle. They primarily cultivate corn and peanuts, with cotton being their sole cash crop. They are successful at their subsistence lifestyle, graciously providing goods and services for each other when needed, but the opportunities to bring in cash income are few and far between. Any Segou native who completes high school leaves the village for lack of employment. Besides the non-Segou native Senegalese brought in by the Government and NGOs there are five individuals who any sort of formal employment; there is one shop owner and four individuals selling meals for breakfast and lunch. To earn money many heads of house holds harvest bamboo and raphia palm from the bush or leave the village for weeks or months at a time to find whatever work they can in larger towns.</p>
