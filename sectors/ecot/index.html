<h3>What is ecotourism?</h3>

<p>Ecotourism is the responsible travel to natural areas that helps both protect the environment and promote the sustainable development of the local population.</p>

<p>Eco-tourism Volunteers [there are currently 11] are working in collaboration with their counterparts to help people living near national parks and reserves and other tourist attractions in Senegal to develop eco-tourism products and services that will generate income and improve their ability to conserve the environment. </p>
 
<p>The Volunteers have helped organize local eco-tourism management committees and have raised awareness on the part of community members about the advantages and risks of eco-tourism.  In addition to assisting their communities with eco-tourism-related planning, the Eco-tourism Volunteers have provided training on business planning, accounting, marketing, and other aspects of business management, as well as information technology, to individuals and associations in their communities. </p>
 
<p>They have also designed and implemented professional training programs for local guides and eco-guards, assisted in the development of tourist brochures and interpretive guides, created environmental clubs at local schools, and improved the marketing of their sites as tourist destinations.</p>
<p>Peace Corps volunteers are currently working on ecotourism projects in:
