<h2>Food Security Grant Application Process</h2>

<p>Follow these steps when applying for a Food Security Grant:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Do your research
    <ul>
      <li>Review all of the forms that you will need to fill out</li>
      <li>Talk to your APCD about your project idea and whether your project is a good fit for a Food Security grant.</li>
      <li>Talk to your community leaders and come up with a basic plan, schedule, and budget</li>
      <li>Review the example Food Security grants</li>
    </ul></li>  
  <li>Discuss the basic plan with your APCD in more detail and let them know that you will be making a proposal.</li>
  <li>Fill out the following forms, which are combined in the following file: “Food Security Proposal Forms.doc” from PCSenegal.org:
    <ul>
      <li>Agreement Form</li>
      <li>Consent Form</li>
      <li>Abstract</li>
      <li>In addition, submit a Grant Summary and Budget (can be two separate documents, if needed) describing the project in more detail and providing the specifics of the budget.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Food Security documents are then emailed to Joe Mrva (<a href="mailto:jmrva@hotmail.com">jmrva@hotmail.com</a>) and Arame Ngom (<a href="mailto:ANGOM@sn.peacecorps.gov">ANGOM@sn.peacecorps.gov</a>).  That way, if either Joe or Arame is out of the office, the grant review process can still continue.  Arame acknowledges receipt by text.</li>
  <li>Joe and Arame review, check for any missing parts, provide feedback and ask questions.  This can be done by phone call, text, or email.  Once the version is acceptable to Joe and Arame, they pass the grant to the PCV’s APCD.</li>
  <li>APCD provides any feedback, sends it back to Joe & Arame for any final changes.</li>
  <li>Proposal is reviewed after the SPA Review Committee Meeting.  Arame sends PCV text to let them know of date of consideration.</li>
  <li>Once proposal is accepted, rejected or needs modification, Arame sends the PCV an email and then let’s PCV know by text that they should check their email (about 1 day after the SPA Review Committee has met).</li>
  <li>Once the grant is revised per the Food Security Committee’s comments (as applicable), the approved grant is sent to Finance for processing.  Arame sends PCV a text that the grant was sent to Finance and that the money will arrive the PCV’s bank account in 3-4 weeks.</li>
  <li>PCV completes the project, and saves all receipts for money that was spent.</li>
  <li>PCV completes the Food Security Completion Report and Project Log (the forms are combined in the following file: “Food Security Proposal Forms.doc” from PCSenegal.org).   PCV submits the Completion Report, Project Log, and Receipts to Arame.  Make sure that all receipts are labeled and organized so that it is easy to understand where the project money was spent.</li>
  <li>In addition, all completed projects need to have a case study of the project for the web site.</li></ol>
