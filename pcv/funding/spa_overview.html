<h2>SPA Grant Application Process</h2>
<p>Follow these steps when applying for a SPA Grant:
<ol>
  <li>Do your research
    <ul>
      <li>Read the SPA Guidelines</li>
      <li>Review all of the forms that you will need to fill out</li>
      <li>Talk to your APCD about your project idea and which Program Area/Element your project fits best into.  Discuss the indicators within that Program Area/Element with your APCD or Joe Mrva, or Arame Ngom</li> 
      <li>Talk to your community leaders and come up with a basic plan, schedule, and budget</li>
      <li>Review the example SPA grants</li>
    </ul> </li> 
  <li>PCV discusses the basic plan with APCD in more detail and lets them know that they will be making proposal</li>
  <li>PCV fills out the following documents, which they download from PCSenegal.org:
    <ul>
      <li>Agreement Form</li>
      <li>Consent Form</li>
      <li>Abstract</li>
      <li>In addition, PCV submits a Grant Summary and Budget (can be two separate documents, if needed) describing the project in more detail and providing the specifics of the budget</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>SPA documents are emailed to Joe Mrva (<a href="mailto:jmrva@hotmail.com">jmrva@hotmail.com</a>) and Arame Ngom (<a href="mailto:angom@sn.peacecorps.gov">ANGOM@sn.peacecorps.gov</a>).  That way, if either Joe or Arame is out of the office, the grant review process can still continue.  Arame acknowledges receipt by text.</li> 
  <li>Joe and Arame review, check for any missing parts, provide feedback and ask questions.  This can be done by phone call, text, or email.  Once the version is acceptable to Joe and Arame, they pass the grant to the PCV’s APCD</li>
  <li>APCD provides any feedback, sends it back to Joe & Arame for any final changes.</li>
  <li>Proposal is sent to the SPA Review Committee.  Arame sends PCV text to let them know of date of consideration.</li>
  <li>Once proposal is accepted, rejected or needs modification, Arame sends the PCV an email and then let’s PCV know by text that they should check their email (about 1 day after the SPA Review Committee has met).</li>
  <li>Once the grant is revised per the SPA Review Committee’s comments (as applicable), the approved grant is sent to Finance for processing.  Arame sends PCV a text that the grant was sent to Finance and that the money will arrive the PCV’s bank account in 3-4 weeks.</li>
  <li>PCV completes the project, and saves all receipts for money that was spent.</li>
  <li>PCV completes the SPA Completion Report and Project Log.  PCV submits the SPA Completion Report, Project Log, and Receipts to Arame.  Make sure that all receipts are labeled and organized so that it is easy to understand where the project money was spent.</li>
  <li>In addition, all completed projects need to have a case study of the project for the web site.</li></ol>
