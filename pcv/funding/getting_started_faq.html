<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<ol><li><i>What is a grant?</i><br />
A grant is an award of financial assistance from a charitable organization, corporation, or federal agency to a recipient to carry out a public purpose.</li><br />
<li><i>Why do people and organizations give grant money away?</i><br />
Grant money is awarded to recipients to advance a purpose which provides long term benefits to a community.</li><br />
