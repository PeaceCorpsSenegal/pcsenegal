<h2>Project Design and Grant Writing Basics</h2>
<ol><li><b>Project Ideas</b><br />
Project ideas are generated through your involvement in your community and through your discussions with community leaders, counterparts, other Peace Corps Volunteers, and your APCD.  Projects should be community driven and should serve a need in the community.  When first considering a project, start thinking about how it might be funded.</li> 
<li><b>Research</b><br />
Ask around and find out if this project is already being done.  Are you duplicating work that has already being done?  What resources are available locally to do the project?  How much time and roughly how much money will be needed?</li>
<li><b>Project Planning</b><br />
Discuss the project in more detail with your APCD and your community leaders.  Compile enough information that you can have a fairly detailed discussion on the project.  Identify the top tasks that are needed to complete the project and sequence them.  Begin compiling the specifics of the budget by identifying costs to accomplish key tasks.  Prepare your basic plan on how you will monitor key tasks during the project to ensure that you are on track.  Keep your end goals in mind and decide on how you will measure your success.  Identify the top risks in the project and show how you will be able to reduce those risks.</li>
<li><b>Choosing a Funding Source</b><br />
Take the time to research which funding options are open to you and what requirements each may have.  For example, if SPA money is available to fund a school garden, which indicators are you required to measure to show that your project was successful?  Be sure to consider how much money is available in that funding option since sometimes, funds can go quickly.  Take the time to ask questions and understand how the funding process works before you submit your application for grant funds.</li>
